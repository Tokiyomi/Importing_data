And never were girls more unlike.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia Peabody, the oldest of the four, hailed from Massachusetts\\r\\nand appeared almost as stern and forbidding as the rock-bound coasts.\\r\\nPrivately the others insisted in the early part of their acquaintance\\r\\nthat this same Eugenia must have been born an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cold maid.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMildred Thornton was the daughter of a distinguished New York judge and\\r\\nher mother a prominent society woman. But Mildred herself cared little\\r\\nfor a butterfly existence. With the call of the suffering sounding in\\r\\nher ears she had given up a luxurious existence for the hardships and\\r\\nperils of a Red Cross nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youngest of the four girls, Barbara Meade, was a very small person\\r\\nwith a large store of energy and unexpectedness. And the last girl,\\r\\nNona Davis, was a native of the conservative old city of Charleston,\\r\\nSouth Carolina. Although a mystery shadowed her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history, Nona\\r\\nhad been brought up by her father, a one-time Confederate general, with\\r\\nall the ideas and traditions of the old South.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet in spite of these contrasts in their natures and lives, the four\\r\\nAmerican Red Cross girls had spent more than six months caring for\\r\\nthe wounded British soldiers in the Sacred Heart Hospital in northern\\r\\nFrance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the closing of the last story the news had come that the\\r\\nheadquarters of the hospital must be changed at once. At any hour the\\r\\nGerman invaders might swarm into the countryside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere had been but little time to remove the wounded. So, not wishing\\r\\nto add to the responsibilities and finding themselves more in the way\\r\\nthan of service, the four girls had escaped together to a small town in\\r\\nFrance farther away from the enemy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s line.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere they concluded to offer their aid to the Croix de Rouge, or the\\r\\nRed Cross Society of France.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this was in the spring, and now another autumn has come round.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne wonders what the four American girls are doing and where they are\\r\\nliving.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great square in front of the Grand Opera House in Paris surged with\\r\\nexcited people.\\r\\n\\r\\nAutomobiles and carriages crowded with men and women, waving\\r\\ntri-colored flags, filled the streets. It was a warm October night with\\r\\na brilliant canopy of stars overhead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVive la France! Vive l\\xe2\\x80\\x99Arm\\xc3\\xa9e!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the throng shouted, swaying backward\\r\\nand forward in its effort to draw closer to the great palace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere must have been between five and ten thousand persons in the\\r\\nneighborhood, for tonight France was celebrating her greatest\\r\\nachievement of the war. At last the news had come that the victorious\\r\\nFrench army had driven the Germans back across the frontiers of\\r\\nAlsace-Lorraine. Once again the French flag was planted within their\\r\\nlost provinces.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAllons, enfants, de la patrie,\\r\\n   Le jour de gloire est arriv\\xc3\\xa9.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the crowd a woman had started the singing of the _Marseillaise_.\\r\\nImmediately thousands of voices joined in the song, while thousands of\\r\\nfeet kept time upon the paving stones to this greatest of all marching\\r\\nmeasures.\\r\\n\\r\\nSix broad streets in Paris converge into a triangular square which\\r\\nis known as the Place de l\\xe2\\x80\\x99Opera. From here one looks upward to the\\r\\nopera house itself, a splendid building three stories in height and\\r\\napproached by a broad flight of stone steps.\\r\\n\\r\\nStanding within the crowd, a little to the left of the opera, was a\\r\\ngroup of five persons, four of them girls, while the fifth was a young\\r\\nman whose coat was buttoned in such a fashion that he appeared to have\\r\\nbut one arm. However, the other arm hung limp and useless underneath\\r\\nhis coat.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough their appearance and accents were those of foreigners, two\\r\\nof the girls in the little party were singing along with the French\\r\\ncrowd. The other two were silent, although their faces expressed equal\\r\\ninterest and animation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly the singing of the street crowd ceased. The central door of\\r\\nthe opera house had been thrown open and a young woman came out upon\\r\\nthe portico. She was dressed in a clinging white robe and wore upon her\\r\\nhead a diadem of brilliants, while in her hands she carried the French\\r\\nflag. So skilfully had the lights been arranged behind her that she\\r\\ncould be seen for a great distance. To the onlookers she represented\\r\\nthe symbolic female figure of the great French Republic, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLibert\\xc3\\xa9,\\r\\nEgalit\\xc3\\xa9, Fraternit\\xc3\\xa9.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment after her appearance there was a breathless silence, then\\r\\nthe next even more enthusiastic shouts resounded:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVive Chenel! Vive Chenel!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hats were thrown into the air, thousands of\\r\\nflags waved, while myriads of handkerchiefs fluttered like white doves.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a night to be always remembered by the people who shared its\\r\\nrapture.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAux armes, citoyens, formez vos bataillons!\\r\\n   Marchons! Marchons!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the closing of the final verse of the _Marseillaise_, in the midst\\r\\nof the wild applause, the smallest of the four girls in the little\\r\\ngroup placed her hand gently upon the armless sleeve of her young man\\r\\ncompanion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTonight makes up for a good deal, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it, Dick?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she queried\\r\\na little wistfully. As she spoke her blue eyes were shining with\\r\\nexcitement, while a warm color flooded her cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young fellow nodded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is the greatest spectacle I ever saw and\\r\\none we shall never forget,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYet there will be a greater\\r\\nnight to come when this war is finally over, though when that night\\r\\nwill be no one can foretell.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDick Thornton spoke gravely and seemed weary from the evening\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nexcitement. But then something of what he had passed through in the\\r\\nlast six months showed in other ways than in his empty coat sleeve.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout his knowledge, the girl who had been speaking continued to\\r\\nstudy him for another moment. Then she turned to Mildred Thornton, who\\r\\nwas on her other side, and whispered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMill, Dick is tired, but would rather die than confess it. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you\\r\\nthink of some way to get us out of this crowd before the breaking up\\r\\nbegins? The jam then will be awful and we may not be able to keep\\r\\ntogether.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nUp to the instant of Barbara Meade\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suggestion, Mildred had forgotten\\r\\nall personal matters in her interest in the music and the vivid beauty\\r\\nof the scene surrounding them. Now she too glanced toward her brother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDick,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she suggested at once, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you think we had best start back\\r\\ntoward our pension? Madame Chenel is to sing an encore and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sorry we\\r\\nmust miss it, but I really think it would be more sensible to go.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the closing of the _Marseillaise_ the celebrated singer had\\r\\ndisappeared. Now in the midst of Mildred\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remark she returned to the\\r\\nbalcony of the Opera House. No longer was she wearing her crown of\\r\\nbrilliants, nor carrying the immense French flag. Instead her head was\\r\\nuncovered, showing her dark hair and eyes and the flag she bore was\\r\\nBritish, not French.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she began singing in English, but with a delicious French accent:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a long way to Tipperary,\\r\\n      It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a long way to go.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crowd joined in the chorus. There were soldiers on the street, who\\r\\nhad returned to Paris on leaves of absence, after learning English from\\r\\nthe Tommies in the trenches. Others had only a faint knowledge of a few\\r\\nEnglish words. But everybody sang, and because some of the voices were\\r\\nFrench and others English the effect was all the more thrilling and\\r\\namusing.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally Dick hesitated for a moment, then he remembered his own\\r\\ncondition. Certainly he would be powerless to push their way through\\r\\nthe great throng. Then if by chance rioting should break out from sheer\\r\\nexcitement, it would be impossible for him to protect four girls.\\r\\nTrue, the American Red Cross girls were fairly well able to look after\\r\\nthemselves in most emergencies. But Dick Thornton did not like the idea\\r\\nof having them put to the test at such a time and under the present\\r\\ncircumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am afraid you are right, Mildred,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he agreed reluctantly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nform a single file; I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go first and all of you follow me. Tell the\\r\\nothers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMildred at once put her arm inside a young woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s who was standing\\r\\nnear her, apparently oblivious of the past conversation. Yet one would\\r\\nhave expected Eugenia Peabody to have been first to have made the\\r\\nsensible suggestion of the past few moments. Yet it was Barbara Meade\\r\\nwith whom it had actually originated.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Eugenia too had been swept off her feet with enthusiasm. Moreover,\\r\\nshe could scarcely make up her mind now to agree to leave, although\\r\\nplainly appreciating the situation. Eugenia looked surprisingly\\r\\nhandsome tonight.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place, she wore a new Paris frock, which after long\\r\\ninsistence the other three girls had persuaded her to buy. It was an\\r\\ninexpensive dress of dark-blue cloth and silk, but it was stylishly\\r\\nmade and extremely becoming. Above all, Eugenia had at last discarded\\r\\nthe unattractive hat in which she had set sail, and which she had\\r\\nresolutely worn until this day. The new one had only cost five francs,\\r\\nbut one should see the character of hat that can be bought in Paris for\\r\\none dollar!\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia, it is true, had begrudged even that small amount for her own\\r\\nadornment, until Nona and Barbara had refused to appear upon the street\\r\\nwith her still in her ancient \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlpine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d However, although she rebelled\\r\\nagainst the unnecessary extravagance, so far Eugenia had not regretted\\r\\nher purchases.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the present moment she was standing next to Nona Davis and turned to\\r\\nspeak to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNona, I am sorry when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all so wonderful, but we must start back to\\r\\nthe pension at once. Please come on,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she insisted authoritatively.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Eugenia had every reason to believe that Nona heard her words\\r\\nand agreed with her. She even thought that Nona moved on a few paces\\r\\nbehind her. Moreover, this is exactly what she did. Nevertheless, Nona\\r\\nafterwards insisted that her act must have been purely involuntary,\\r\\nsince she was not conscious of having heard or obeyed her companion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the little group of five Americans had been enthralled by the\\r\\nnight\\xe2\\x80\\x99s excitement, it was Nona Davis who was most completely swept off\\r\\nher feet. Never had she even dreamed of such beauty and glamour as this\\r\\ngala night in Paris offered!\\r\\n\\r\\nSo little even of her own land had Nona seen, nothing save Charleston\\r\\nand the surrounding neighborhood and the view from her car window on\\r\\nher way to New York City.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe few days in London had been overhung with the thought of the work\\r\\nahead. But here in Paris for the past week the four Red Cross girls had\\r\\nbeen enjoying a brief holiday and were completely under the spell of\\r\\nthe fascinating and beautiful city.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon persons with a far wider experience of life and places than Nona\\r\\nDavis, Paris frequently casts this same spell. Indeed, it sometimes\\r\\nseems impossible that a city can be so beautiful and yet suited to the\\r\\nuses of everyday life. Both in Paris and in Venice one often expects to\\r\\nwake up and find the city a dream and not a reality.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly Nona had turned automatically to do as Eugenia had commanded\\r\\nher. But unfortunately, at the same moment Madame Chenel finished her\\r\\nEnglish song and began at once on another which by an odd chance had a\\r\\nreminiscent quality for Nona. Instinctively she paused to listen and\\r\\nremember.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer impression of the song was one of long ago. Nona\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother had\\r\\nonce been in New Orleans. Now the vision came to her daughter of an\\r\\nold-fashioned spinet at one end of the drawing room in her home in\\r\\nCharleston, and of a young woman in a white dress with blue ribbons\\r\\nsitting there singing this same French verse.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the moment everything else was forgotten. The girl simply stood\\r\\nspellbound until the great artist finished. Only when she began bowing\\r\\nher thanks to the applauding crowd, did Nona turn again to look for\\r\\nEugenia and her other friends. But as more than five minutes had passed\\r\\nsince their warning, and as they had believed Nona following them, no\\r\\none of the four could be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, at this same moment the great crowd began to break up. Then,\\r\\nas is always the case, everybody struggled to get away at the same\\r\\nmoment.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust at first Nona was not alarmed at finding herself alone; she was\\r\\nsimply bewildered. However, because she was endeavoring to stand still\\r\\nwhile every one else was moving, she was constantly being shoved from\\r\\nside to side.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer first intention was to remain in the same place for a few moments.\\r\\nThen Dick or one of the girls would probably return for her. However,\\r\\nshe soon appreciated that no human being could push their way back\\r\\nthrough the thronging multitude. Moreover, she too must move along or\\r\\nbe trampled upon.\\r\\n\\r\\nFortunately, the fact that she was alone did not seem to have been\\r\\nobserved. For although the people in her neighborhood were not\\r\\nrough and ugly, as an English or Teutonic crowd might have been,\\r\\nnevertheless, Nona knew that for a young girl to be alone at night in\\r\\nthe streets of Paris was an unheard-of thing. Besides, later on the\\r\\ncrowd might indulge in noisier ways of celebrating the German defeat\\r\\nthan by listening to the singing of the great prima donna.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat had she best do? As she was being pushed along, Nona was also\\r\\nthinking rapidly, although somewhat confusedly. She had not been on the\\r\\nstreet alone since her arrival. Both Mildred and Dick Thornton were\\r\\nfamiliar with Paris and had been acting as the others\\xe2\\x80\\x99 escorts.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir little French pension happened to be over on the other side of\\r\\nParis. Fortunately, Nona remembered that she could find a bus near the\\r\\nMadeleine, the famous church not more than a dozen blocks away from the\\r\\nneighborhood of the opera. But how to reach this destination and what\\r\\nbus to take after her arrival? These were problems still to be dealt\\r\\nwith. First of all, she must keep her forlorn condition a secret from\\r\\nobservers in order not to be spoken to by an impertinent stranger.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally Nona appreciated that it was impossible for all Frenchmen to\\r\\nbe equally courteous. Therefore, one of them might misunderstand her\\r\\npresent predicament.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, as there was nothing else to do she continued moving with the\\r\\ncrowd. In the meantime she kept assuring herself that it was absurd to\\r\\nbe so nervous over an ordinary adventure. Think what experiences she\\r\\nhad so lately passed through as a Red Cross nurse!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if she had only been wearing her nurse\\xe2\\x80\\x99s uniform, always it served\\r\\nas a protection! Yet naturally when one was off duty and merely a\\r\\nholiday visitor in a city, it was pleasanter to dress like other\\r\\npersons.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Eugenia, Nona was also wearing a new frock. Hers was of black\\r\\nsilk with a hat of black tulle, making her fair hair and skin more\\r\\nconspicuous by contrast. Certainly she would be apt to attract\\r\\nattention among the darker, more vividly colored French girls.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Nona had gone half the distance to the Madeleine before she was\\r\\nannoyed. Then just as she was about to cross the street at one of the\\r\\ncorners, an arm was unexpectedly slipped through hers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith her heart pounding with terror and every bit of color drained from\\r\\nher cheeks, Nona looked up into the eyes of an impertinent youth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLa belle Americaine!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he announced insolently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II _Another Meeting_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next instant Nona recovered her poise. She was, however, both\\r\\nfrightened and angry. Yet if it were possible to avoid it, she did not\\r\\nwish to raise an alarm nor create any kind of commotion upon the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first quietly and firmly she attempted removing her arm, at the\\r\\nsame time regarding the Frenchman with an expression of scorn and\\r\\ndisapproval.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet me go at once,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, speaking excellent French, so there was\\r\\nno possibility of being misunderstood.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the young man only shrugged his shoulders, looking, if she had but\\r\\nknown it, more mischievous than wicked.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Nona was now gazing despairingly about her. There were numbers\\r\\nof persons near by, stout mothers and fathers, the respectable\\r\\ntradespeople of Paris, with the usual French family of two children.\\r\\nNona could, of course, appeal to any one of them. But just at the\\r\\ninstant no one was sufficiently near to accost without raising her\\r\\nvoice. This would, of course, attract public attention, which, if\\r\\npossible, Nona did not wish to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she waited another second, hoping her tormentor would release her\\r\\nof his own accord. Finding he did not intend this, she glanced about\\r\\nfor assistance a second time. Then she discovered two young officers\\r\\npassing within a few feet of her. One of them wore a British uniform\\r\\nand the other French.\\r\\n\\r\\nNona spoke quickly, knowing instinctively that the men were gentlemen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStop a moment, please!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am a stranger and have lost my\\r\\nfriends in the crowd. This man is annoying me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen in spite of her efforts the girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice shook with nervousness\\r\\nwhile her eyes filled with humiliated tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith her first words the two officers whirled around. At the same\\r\\nmoment Nona\\xe2\\x80\\x99s persecutor started to run. However, he was not quick\\r\\nenough, for the young French officer managed to slip his scabbard\\r\\nbetween the fellow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feet. At once he was face down on the ground and\\r\\nonly brought upright again by the officer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand on his collar.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the interval the other young man was gazing at Nona Davis in\\r\\nsurprise and perhaps with something like pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Davis,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he began, lifting his officer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cap formally, \\xe2\\x80\\x9care we\\r\\nnever to meet except under extraordinary circumstances? You may not\\r\\nremember me, but I am Lieutenant Hume, Colonel Dalton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aide. Perhaps\\r\\nyou recall that unfortunate affair in which Miss Thornton was concerned\\r\\nat the Sacred Heart Hospital? But before that you know there was our\\r\\nfirst meeting at the gardener\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cottage in Surrey.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was unnecessary for Lieutenant Hume to present Nona with all\\r\\nhis credentials of acquaintance. For at this instant she was too\\r\\nunreservedly glad to see him. To have discovered some one whom she knew\\r\\nat such a trying time was an unexpected boon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am, you see--oh, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t explain now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nona protested. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut,\\r\\nLieutenant Hume, if you have nothing very important to do, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you\\r\\nbe kind enough to put me on the right bus. I am trying to get back\\r\\nto our pension. And though I am sorry to be so stupid, I am lost and\\r\\ndreadfully frightened.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hand that Nona now extended to her English acquaintance was cold\\r\\nwith nervousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nLieutenant Hume took it and bowed courteously. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course I will take\\r\\nyou home with the greatest pleasure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he returned. At the same time he\\r\\nsmiled to himself:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGirls are indeed strange creatures, say what you will! Here is a young\\r\\nAmerican girl who has been doing Red Cross work near the battlefield.\\r\\nShe has been able to keep her head and remain cool and collected among\\r\\nwar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s horrors, but because she has been spoken to on the street by a\\r\\nyoung ruffian she is terrified and confused.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Possibly she would have\\r\\nscorned his protection in the face of an artillery charge, when under\\r\\nthe present conditions a masculine protector was fairly useful.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow for the first time the young French officer spoke. He had just\\r\\ngiven his captive a rough shake and then straightened him up again\\r\\nafter a second attempt to get away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat shall I do with this fellow, Mademoiselle?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked, speaking\\r\\nEnglish with difficulty, but showing extraordinarily white, even teeth\\r\\nunder a small, dark moustache. Indeed, Nona decided that she had never\\r\\nseen a more charming and debonair figure than the young French officer,\\r\\nwhen he finally engaged her attention. He could scarcely have been more\\r\\nthan five feet, four inches tall, yet his figure was perfectly built.\\r\\nHe was slender, but from the casual fashion in which he gripped the\\r\\nother man, who was several inches taller and far heavier, he must have\\r\\nbeen extraordinarily strong.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, let the man go, please,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nona murmured weakly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I know I\\r\\nshould have you turn him over to a gendarme and appear against him in\\r\\ncourt, but really I should hate doing it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl smiled at the young French officer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s evident disappointment.\\r\\nHe made no protest, however; only he gave the man another half-savage\\r\\nshake and said rapidly in French:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you with the army, you miserable loafer? Your name at\\r\\nonce?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then, when the offender mumbled something indistinguishable:\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cReport to me at the barracks tomorrow. Oh, I shall find you again,\\r\\nnever fear, and it will then be imprisonment for you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moment after the man had run away the French officer stood at\\r\\nattention with his shoulders erect and his feet together. The next he\\r\\nbowed to Nona in an exquisitely correct fashion, as Lieutenant Hume\\r\\nintroduced him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Davis, my friend, Captain Henri Castaigne, one of the youngest\\r\\ncaptains in the French army.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lieutenant Hume then added boyishly:\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTomorrow he is to be presented with the Cross of the Legion of Honor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNona was naturally impressed by such an introduction. But evidently\\r\\nthe young officer preferred not having his praises sung to a complete\\r\\nstranger. He pretended not even to have heard his friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s last remark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will say au revoir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he returned graciously. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSince you and\\r\\nLieutenant Hume are old acquaintances, he will prefer to take you to\\r\\nyour friends unaccompanied by me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was about to withdraw when Nona interposed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you must have had some engagement together for the evening. Now\\r\\nif you separate on my account your evening will be spoiled. So please\\r\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t trouble to take me all the way to the pension; just find my\\r\\nomnibus and----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth young men laughed. The idea of leaving a girl alone in such an\\r\\nextremity was of course an absurdity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, come along, Henri, Miss Davis will be able to endure your society\\r\\nfor a few moments as long as I was braced to endure it all evening.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nLieutenant Hume added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBesides, it may help your education to talk\\r\\nto an American girl. Castaigne does not know a thing except military\\r\\ntactics; he is rather a duffer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the English officer continued half\\r\\nproudly and half with a pretense of contempt. It was not difficult to\\r\\ndiscover that there was a good deal of affection existing between the\\r\\ntwo young officers of the Allied armies.\\r\\n\\r\\nNona wondered how they happened to know each other so intimately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the way, Lieutenant Hume,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked, when they had finally reached\\r\\nthe desired square and stood waiting their turn on the overcrowded\\r\\nomnibus. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow in the world do you chance to be in Paris instead of\\r\\nat the front? The last time I heard of you, you were in the midst of\\r\\ndesperate fighting.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man answered so quietly that no one except his two companions\\r\\ncould hear. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am in Paris on a private mission for the British\\r\\nGovernment. I am not at liberty to say anything more.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNona flushed, a little confused at having appeared to be curious when\\r\\nshe had only meant to be friendly. But immediately Lieutenant Hume\\r\\ninquired:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMay I ask the same question of you? How do you chance to be in Paris?\\r\\nDid you come here after the Sacred Heart Hospital was closed? I knew\\r\\nthat one side of it had been struck by a shell and partly destroyed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNona nodded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, but let us not talk of that now, if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind.\\r\\nWe had to move the wounded soldiers, the supplies and everything in a\\r\\ntremendous hurry. So we are resting now for a short time and afterwards\\r\\nmean to go into southern France to help with the hospital work there.\\r\\nBut hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tonight\\xe2\\x80\\x99s celebration been too wonderful? It is the very\\r\\nfirst victory I have ever helped to celebrate and it has made me very\\r\\nhappy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen you are not entirely neutral, as you Americans are supposed to\\r\\nbe?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lieutenant Hume queried, waiting with more interest than was\\r\\nnatural for his companion\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reply. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought Red Cross doctors and\\r\\nnurses were expected to have no feeling about the war.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNona hesitated. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course, that is true so far as our nursing goes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nshe replied. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNaturally I would nurse any soldier without its making\\r\\nthe least difference what his nationality might be. But when it comes\\r\\nto a question of my own personal feeling, well, that is a different\\r\\nmatter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNona\\xe2\\x80\\x99s answer was a little incoherent; nevertheless, her companion\\r\\nseemed to find it satisfactory.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn arriving at the pension Eugenia herself opened the door. The\\r\\nconcierge had previously admitted the girl and her two escorts to the\\r\\nground floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment where the four girls and Dick Thornton were at present\\r\\nboarding occupied the third floor of an old house that had once\\r\\nbelonged to an ancient French family and had afterwards been converted\\r\\ninto an apartment building. Such houses are common in Paris. The\\r\\natmosphere of this one was gloomy and imposing and the hallway very\\r\\ndark.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first Eugenia only saw Nona outside or she might have been more\\r\\namiable. However, she had been so frightened for the past hour that she\\r\\nwas thoroughly angry, an effect fright often has upon people.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNona, what does this mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she demanded, speaking like an outraged\\r\\nschool-marm. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have given us one of the worst hours any one of us\\r\\nhas ever spent. Why did you not come along with the rest of us? Of\\r\\ncourse, no one wished to leave; it was quite as much of a sacrifice for\\r\\nus as for you. Now Mildred and Barbara and Dick have had to go back to\\r\\nlook for you and to inform the police of your disappearance. I have\\r\\nwaited here, hoping for a message from them or you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I know. I am dreadfully sorry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nona replied more apologetically\\r\\nthan she actually felt. Naturally regretting the trouble she had given,\\r\\nyet she did not enjoy being scolded before entire strangers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEugenia,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she protested, changing the tone of her voice in an effort\\r\\nto stem the tide of her friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s resentment, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was so fortunate as\\r\\nto meet Lieutenant Hume on the street. You may recall he was Colonel\\r\\nDalton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s companion when he visited the Sacred Heart Hospital. He and\\r\\nhis friend have been good enough to bring me home. I should like to\\r\\nhave you meet them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly Eugenia was somewhat nonplussed on discovering that there\\r\\nhad been an audience to overhear her reproaches. Still she was no less\\r\\noffended. However, she could not exactly make up her mind to refuse to\\r\\nbe introduced to Nona\\xe2\\x80\\x99s acquaintances, who had undoubtedly been kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result was that she was stiffer and colder than ever before as she\\r\\nstalked ahead into the pension drawing room, leaving the younger girl\\r\\nand the two men to follow her.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, Eugenia undoubtedly looked plain, partly as the result of her\\r\\nsevere mood and partly of her fatigue and anxiety. She had removed her\\r\\nstreet suit and was wearing a gray frock that might have been cut out\\r\\nby the village carpenter, so free was it from any possible grace or\\r\\nprettiness. The dress had been intended to be useful and undoubtedly\\r\\nhad been, for Eugenia must have been wearing it for the past five years.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Eugenia really believed that she was fairly gracious to the two\\r\\nyoung officers. She shook hands with both of them and asked them to be\\r\\nseated. She even thanked them for escorting the scapegrace home, yet\\r\\nall in a manner that suggested ice trying to thaw on an impossibly cold\\r\\nday.\\r\\n\\r\\nLieutenant Hume paid but little attention to her, being frankly too\\r\\nmuch interested in Nona Davis to do more than be polite to Miss\\r\\nPeabody, whom he regarded strictly in the light of a chaperon.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to Captain Castaigne Eugenia was at once a puzzle and an amusement.\\r\\nIn his life he had never seen any one in the least like her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young French officer belonged to an old and aristocratic French\\r\\nfamily. Had France remained a monarchy instead of becoming a republic,\\r\\nhe would have held a distinguished title. He was not a native of Paris,\\r\\nfor he had been brought up in the country with his mother upon their\\r\\nimpoverished estate. Later, as she considered a soldier\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life the\\r\\nonly one possible for her son, he had attended a military school for\\r\\nofficers. So it was true that he knew but little of women. However,\\r\\nthose he had met previously had been his mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friends and their\\r\\ndaughters. They were women with charming, gracious manners, of unusual\\r\\nculture and refinement. Moreover, they had always been extremely kind\\r\\nto him. Now this remarkable young American woman paid no more attention\\r\\nto him than if he had been a wooden figure, and perhaps not so much.\\r\\nHer appearance and manner recalled an officer whom he had once had as\\r\\na teacher. His colonel had been just such a tall, stern person, who\\r\\nhaving given his orders expected them to be obeyed without demur. So\\r\\nthe young French officer was torn between his desire to laugh, which\\r\\nof course his perfect manners made impossible, and his desire to offer\\r\\nthis Miss Peabody a military salute.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe spoke the most extraordinary French he had ever heard in his life.\\r\\nHer grammar was possibly correct, but such another accent had never\\r\\nbeen listened to on sea or land. Captain Castaigne was not familiar\\r\\nwith Americans, so how could he know that Eugenia spoke French with a\\r\\nBoston intonation?\\r\\n\\r\\nTen, fifteen minutes elapsed, while conversation between Eugenia and\\r\\nthe French officer became more and more impossible. Nevertheless his\\r\\nfriend failed to regard Captain Castaigne\\xe2\\x80\\x99s imploring glances.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the English officer realized that their call was becoming\\r\\nunduly long under the circumstances. Yet before saying farewell he\\r\\nmanaged a few moments of confidential conversation with Nona.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou will persuade your friends to come to the Review tomorrow? I\\r\\nshall call for you more than an hour ahead of time. President Poincar\\xc3\\xa9\\r\\nhimself is to present decorations to a dozen soldiers. I say it would\\r\\nbe rotten for you to miss it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nUndoubtedly Nona agreed with him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are awfully kind. I accept for\\r\\nus all with pleasure and shall look forward then to tomorrow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nreturned. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you again for tonight, and good-by.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III _The Cross of the Legion of Honor_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night just before falling asleep Nona Davis had an unexpected\\r\\nflash of thought. It was odd that Lieutenant Hume, who had been\\r\\na friend in need, should turn out to be such a well-educated and\\r\\nattractive fellow. Moreover, how did it happen that he was a British\\r\\nofficer? Now and then for some especial act of valor, or for some\\r\\nespecial ability, a man was raised from the ranks. Yet Nona did not\\r\\nbelieve either of these things to have happened in Lieutenant Hume\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncase.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was the answer to the puzzle? He was the son of a gardener and\\r\\nshe herself had seen his mother Susan, a comfortable old lady with\\r\\ntwinkling brown eyes, red cheeks, a large bosom and a round waist to\\r\\nmatch. Surely it was difficult to conceive of _her_ as the mother of\\r\\nsuch a son! And especially in England where it was so difficult to\\r\\nrise above one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough tired and sleepy, Nona devoted another ten minutes to her\\r\\nriddle. Then all at once the answer appeared plain enough. Lieutenant\\r\\nHume had doubtless been brought up as the foster brother of a boy\\r\\nof nobler birth and greater riches than he himself possessed. Then,\\r\\ndoubtless, seeing his unusual abilities, he had been given unusual\\r\\nopportunities. Nona had read English novels in which just such\\r\\ninteresting situations occurred, so she felt rather pleased with her\\r\\nown discernment. However, if it were possible to introduce the subject\\r\\nwithout being rude, she intended to make sure of her impression by\\r\\nquestioning Lieutenant Hume. One might so easily begin by discussing\\r\\nEnglish literature, a subject certainly broad enough in itself. Then\\r\\none could mention a particular book, where a foster brother played a\\r\\nconspicuous part. But while trying to recall a story with just the\\r\\nexact situation she required, Nona went to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe and Barbara shared the same room. But fortunately no one of\\r\\nher other friends had been so severe as Eugenia. However, after the\\r\\ndeparture of the two young men, realizing that she had been tiresome,\\r\\nNona had been sufficiently contrite to appease even Eugenia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning at _d\\xc3\\xa9jeuner_ Dick Thornton declared that Nona\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nadventure had really resulted in good fortune for all of them. More\\r\\nthan most things he had desired to attend the review of the fresh\\r\\ntroops about to leave Paris for the firing line. Moreover, it would be\\r\\nuncommonly interesting to see the presentation of the decorations by\\r\\nthe French President. And if Nona had not chanced to meet Lieutenant\\r\\nHume and his friend, neither of these opportunities would have been\\r\\ntheirs. Dick had no chance of securing the special invitations and\\r\\ntickets necessary for seats in the reviewing stand. Privately Dick had\\r\\nintended escaping from the four girls to witness the scene alone. But\\r\\nnow as Lieutenant Hume had invited all of them it would be unnecessary\\r\\nto make this confession.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe review was to take place on a level stretch of country just outside\\r\\nParis between St. Cloud and the Bois.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving in some magical fashion secured two antiquated taxicabs,\\r\\nLieutenant Hume arrived next day at the pension. He and Nona and\\r\\nEugenia started off in one of them, with Barbara, Mildred and Dick in\\r\\nthe other.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the ride into the country Lieutenant Hume talked the greater\\r\\npart of the time about his friend, Captain Castaigne, whom Nona and\\r\\nEugenia had met the evening before. The two men had only known each\\r\\nother since the outbreak of the war, yet a devoted friendship had\\r\\ndeveloped between them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, Nona smiled to herself over Lieutenant Hume\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enthusiasm; it\\r\\nwas so unlike an Englishman to reveal such deep feeling. But for the\\r\\ntime being Captain Henri Castaigne was one of the idols of Paris. The\\r\\nday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s newspapers were full of the gallant deed that had won him the\\r\\nright to the military order France holds most dear, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Cross of the\\r\\nLegion of Honor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, during the early part of the conversation Eugenia\\r\\nscarcely listened. She was too busily and happily engaged in watching\\r\\nthe sights about her. Paris was having a curious effect upon the New\\r\\nEngland girl, one that she did not exactly understand. She was both\\r\\nshocked and fascinated by it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place, she had not anticipated liking Paris. She had\\r\\nonly consented to make the trip because they were in need of rest and\\r\\nthe other girls had chosen Paris. Everything she had ever heard or\\r\\nread concerning Paris had made her feel prejudiced against the city.\\r\\nMoreover, it was totally unlike Eastport, Massachusetts, where Eugenia\\r\\nhad been born and bred and where she had received most of her ideas of\\r\\nlife.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet there was no denying that there was something about Paris that took\\r\\nhold even of Eugenia Peabody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s repressed imagination.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a brilliant autumn afternoon. The taxicab rattled along the\\r\\nChamps Elys\\xc3\\xa9es, under the marvelous Arc de Triomphe and then turned\\r\\ninto the wooded spaces of the Bois.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery now and then Eugenia found a lump rising in her throat and her\\r\\nheart beating curiously fast. It was all so beautiful, both in art and\\r\\nnature. Surely it was impossible to believe that there could be an\\r\\nenemy mad enough to destroy a city that could never be restored to its\\r\\nformer loveliness.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerchance the war had purified Paris, taking away its uglier side in\\r\\nthe healing influence of patriotism. For even Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s New England\\r\\neyes and conscience could find but little to criticize. Naturally many\\r\\nof the costumes worn by the young women she considered reprehensible.\\r\\nThe colors were too bright, the skirts were too short. French women\\r\\nwere really too stylish for her severer tastes. For there was little\\r\\nblack to be seen. This was a gala afternoon, so whatever one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal\\r\\nsorrow, today Paris honored the living.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Eugenia consented to listen Lieutenant Hume had arrived in\\r\\nthe middle of his story, and then she listened only half-heartedly.\\r\\nShe was interested chiefly because the young Captain she had met the\\r\\nevening before was so far from one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s idea of a hero. He was more like\\r\\na figure of a manikin dressed to represent an officer and set up in a\\r\\nshop window. His features were too perfect, he was too graceful, too\\r\\ndebonair! But in truth Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s idea of a soldier must still have been\\r\\nrepresented by the type of man who, shouldering a musket and still in\\r\\nhis farmer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clothes, marched out to meet the enemy at Bunker Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome day Eugenia would learn that it takes all manner of men and women\\r\\nto make a world. And that there are worthwhile people and things that\\r\\ndo not come from Boston.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was in the face of the enemy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fire when a shell exploded under\\r\\nhis horse,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lieutenant Hume explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe and the horse were shot\\r\\ntwenty feet in the air. When they came down to earth again there was\\r\\nan immense hole in the ground beneath them and both man and horse were\\r\\nplunged into it. Rather like having one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grave dug ahead of time,\\r\\nisn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNona nodded, leaning across from her seat in the cab with her golden\\r\\nbrown eyes darkening with excitement and her hands clasped tight\\r\\ntogether in her lap.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia kept her eyes upon her even while giving her attention to\\r\\nthe narrative. Personally she considered Nona unusually pretty and\\r\\nattractive and the idea worried her now and then. For there were to be\\r\\nno romances if she could prevent them while the four American Red Cross\\r\\ngirls were in Europe. If they wished such undesirable possessions as\\r\\nhusbands they must wait and marry their own countrymen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut Captain Castaigne was not hurt? So he still managed to carry the\\r\\nmessages to his General?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nona demanded. She was much interested in\\r\\ngetting the details of the story before seeing its hero again.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Hume was talking quietly. Nevertheless it was self-evident that\\r\\nhe was only pretending to his casual tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course Captain Castaigne was injured. There would have been no\\r\\nreason why any notice should have been taken of him if he had only\\r\\ndone his ordinary duty. Fact is, when he crawled out he was covered\\r\\nwith blood and nearly dead. The horse was killed outright and Henri\\r\\nalmost so. Nevertheless he managed to run on foot under heavy fire to\\r\\nheadquarters with his message. No one knows how he accomplished it and\\r\\nhe knows least of all. He simply is the kind of fellow who does the\\r\\nthing he starts out to do. We Anglo-Saxons don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always understand\\r\\nthe iron purpose under the charm and good looks these French fellows\\r\\nhave. But fortunately we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t often use cavalrymen now for carrying\\r\\ndespatches. Motor cars do the work better when there is no telephone\\r\\nconnection.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m truly glad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nona murmured softly. She was thinking of\\r\\nhow many gallant young cavalry officers both in France and England\\r\\nthose first terrible months of the war had cut down, before the lessons\\r\\nof the new warfare had been learned.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Eugenia had now awakened to a slight interest in the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour young friend looks fit enough now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she remarked dryly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English officer was not pleased with Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tone. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNevertheless,\\r\\nCaptain Castaigne has been dangerously ill in a hospital for many\\r\\nmonths, although he is returning to his regiment tomorrow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this speech there was no further opportunity for conversation.\\r\\nThe two cabs had driven through the Bois and were now in sight of the\\r\\nfield where the review was to be held.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrawn up at the left were two new regiments about to depart for the\\r\\nfront. Most of the soldiers were boys of nineteen who would have\\r\\nfinished their terms of military service in the following year, but\\r\\nbecause of necessity were answering France\\xe2\\x80\\x99s call today. They were\\r\\nwearing the new French uniform of gray, which is made for real service,\\r\\nand not the old-fashioned one with the dark-blue coat and crimson\\r\\ntrousers. These too often formed conspicuous targets for the enemy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nguns.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcross from the recruits stood another line of about fifty men. They\\r\\nwere old men with gray hair. If their shoulders were still erect\\r\\nand their heads up it was not because this was now their familiar\\r\\ncarriage. It was because this great day had inspired them. For they\\r\\nwere the old soldiers who had been gallant fighters in 1870, when\\r\\nFrance had fought her other war with Germany. Now they were too old\\r\\nto be sent to the firing line. Nevertheless, each one of them was\\r\\nprivately armed and ready to defend his beloved Paris to the last gasp\\r\\nshould the enemy again come to possess it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the two lines and on horseback were President Poincar\\xc3\\xa9,\\r\\nFrance\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new war minister and half a dozen other members of the Cabinet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen standing in a small group separated from the others were the\\r\\nsoldiers who were about to be decorated for especial bravery.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Lieutenant Hume was struggling to find places for his guests,\\r\\nNona was vainly endeavoring to discover the young French officer whom\\r\\nshe had met so unexpectedly the evening before. She was anxious to\\r\\npoint him out to Mildred and Dick and Barbara.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut after they were seated it was Eugenia who found him first. Captain\\r\\nCastaigne was wearing an ordinary service uniform with no other\\r\\ndecorations besides the emblems of his rank.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen a few moments later President Poincar\\xc3\\xa9 and his staff dismounted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four American girls were distinctly disappointed by the French\\r\\nPresident\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appearance. He is a small, stout man with a beard, very\\r\\nmiddle class and uninteresting looking. Yet he has managed to hold\\r\\nFrance together in times of peace and of war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was indeed a great day for Paris. Rarely are medals for bravery\\r\\nbestowed upon the soldiers save near the scene of battle by the\\r\\nofficers in command. Yet there was little noise and shouting among the\\r\\ncrowd as there had been the evening before. They were unusually silent,\\r\\nthe women and girls not trying now to keep back the tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nSixty-four buglers sounded a salute. Then President Poincar\\xc3\\xa9 marched\\r\\nforward and shook hands with every soldier in the group of twelve.\\r\\nEleven of them were to receive the new French decoration which is\\r\\nknown as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCroix de Guerre.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This is a medal formed of two crossed\\r\\nswords and having a profile of a figure representing the French\\r\\nRepublic in the center. But Captain Castaigne alone was to be honored\\r\\nwith the Cross of the Legion of Honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst President Poincar\\xc3\\xa9 pinned the medal on the breast of a boy\\r\\nsentry. He had stood at the mouth of a trench as the Germans\\r\\napproached, and though wounded in half a dozen places had continued to\\r\\nfire until his companions had been warned of the attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen one after the other each soldier received his country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thanks\\r\\nand the recognition of his especial bravery until at length President\\r\\nPoincar\\xc3\\xa9 came to young Captain Castaigne.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne does not know exactly what it was in the young man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appearance\\r\\nthat touched the older man. Perhaps when you learn to know more of\\r\\nhis character you will be better able to understand. For after the\\r\\nPresident had bestowed the higher decoration upon the young captain, he\\r\\nleaned over and kissed him.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia Peabody had an excellent view of the entire proceeding. Though\\r\\nher lips curled sarcastically, strangely enough her eyes felt absurdly\\r\\nmisty. She much disliked this French custom of the men kissing each\\r\\nother, for Eugenia believed very little in kissing between either\\r\\nmen or women. Nevertheless, she did feel disturbed by the whole\\r\\nperformance, and hoped that her friends were too much engaged to pay\\r\\nattention to her. Above all things Eugenia desired that Barbara Meade\\r\\nshould not observe her weakness. She knew Barbara would never grow\\r\\nweary hereafter of referring to the amazement of Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s giving way\\r\\nto tears in public and without any possible excuse.\\r\\n\\r\\nTen minutes later the review began with a blare of trumpets. Then\\r\\ngravely the new regiments passed before the President and his officers.\\r\\nAfterwards they marched away until a cloud of dust hid them and there\\r\\nwas nothing for the spectators to do but return to their own homes.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, the young French Captain managed to make his way to his\\r\\nEnglish friend. He appeared as indifferent and as debonair as he had\\r\\nthe evening before. One could never have guessed that he had just\\r\\nreceived the greatest honor of his life, and an honor given to but few\\r\\nmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nReference to his decoration he pretended not to be able to understand,\\r\\nalthough Mildred, Barbara and Dick tried to compliment him with their\\r\\nbest school French.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut beyond inclining her head frostily, Eugenia made no attempt at a\\r\\nfurther acquaintance with the young soldier.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, several times when he believed no one was observing him,\\r\\nCaptain Castaigne stole a furtive glance at Eugenia.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was somewhat better looking than she had been the evening before,\\r\\nyet she was by no means a beauty. Moreover, she was still a puzzle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the boy--for after all he was only twenty-three--swallowed a\\r\\nlaugh. At last he had found a real place for Eugenia. No wonder he had\\r\\nthought of his former colonel. Recently he had learned that a regiment\\r\\nof women in Paris were in training as soldiers. He could readily behold\\r\\nEugenia in command.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other three American girls were charming and he was glad to have\\r\\nmet them. But Eugenia he trusted he might never see again. He was glad\\r\\nto be returning to the firing line next day. Let heaven preserve him\\r\\nfrom further acquaintance with such an unattractive person!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV _On the Roof_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne week longer the American Red Cross girls remained in Paris. They\\r\\nwere only tourists for these brief, passing days. Yet all the while\\r\\nthey were waiting for orders. After having nursed the British soldiers\\r\\nfor a number of months, when the Sacred Heart Hospital was no longer in\\r\\nexistence, they had concluded to offer their services to France.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, like soldiers, they also were ready upon short notice\\r\\nto start for the front. But in the meantime there was Paris to be\\r\\ninvestigated, where the October days were like jewels. One saw all that\\r\\nit was humanly possible to see of pictures and people and parks and\\r\\nthen came home to dream of the statues in the Luxembourg, or of Venus\\r\\nin her shaded corner in the Louvre, or else of the figure of Victory\\r\\nmidway up the Louvre\\xe2\\x80\\x99s central staircase.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo one another the girls confessed that it was difficult to think of\\r\\nwar so near at hand, or of the experiences through which they had so\\r\\nlately passed. Yet one saw the streets full of soldiers and knew that a\\r\\ngreat line of fortifications encircled Paris, such as few cities have\\r\\never had in the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history. Also, there were always guns mounted\\r\\non high towers waiting for the coming of the Zeppelin raid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen one night, as luck would have it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbara insisted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe raid\\r\\ncame just in the nick of time. For how could the Germans have dreamed\\r\\nthat we were leaving for southern France the next morning?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, the luggage of the Red Cross girls was actually packed\\r\\nand in spite of war times the girls had added to the amount. Moreover,\\r\\nthey were due to take the ten o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock train next day at the Gare de\\r\\nLyons. So because they were weary, a little sorry at having to leave\\r\\nParis, and yet curious of the new adventures ahead, the four girls\\r\\nretired early.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn one way Paris has conspicuously changed since the outbreak of\\r\\nthe war. She has become an early-to-bed city and except on special\\r\\noccasions her caf\\xc3\\xa9s are all closed after dark.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Dick Thornton, although not leaving with the girls the next day,\\r\\nfound little to amuse him on the same evening. He had said good-night\\r\\nsoon after dinner and then gone for a long walk. For in truth he did\\r\\nnot wish to have an intimate farewell talk with his sister or any one\\r\\nof her friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hazards of war had used Dick pretty severely. He had not come to\\r\\nEurope to act as a soldier; nevertheless, in a tragically short time,\\r\\nbefore he had even begun to be fairly useful, he had paid a cruel\\r\\npenalty. Dick believed that he would never again be able to use his\\r\\nright arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not intend, however, to allow this to make him morose or\\r\\ndisagreeable and so seldom spoke of it. But now and then he used\\r\\nto desert his four feminine companions and walking through the\\r\\nsemi-darkened streets of Paris try to work out a solution for his\\r\\nfuture.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo by chance it was Dick who gave the alarm to the household on the\\r\\nnight of Paris\\xe2\\x80\\x99 long-anticipated Zeppelin raid.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had just come home and was standing idly before the door waiting to\\r\\nawaken the concierge who presides over the destinies of all Parisian\\r\\napartment houses. A beautiful night, the sky was thickly studded with\\r\\nstars, although there was no moon.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly Dick heard a tremendous explosion. Naturally his first thought\\r\\nwas a bomb and then he smiled at himself. In war times every noise\\r\\nsuggested a bomb. This noise may have been nothing but an unusually\\r\\nloud automobile tire explosion. However, Dick was not particularly\\r\\nconvinced by his own suggestion. He remained quiet for another moment\\r\\nwith all his senses acute. The streets in his neighborhood had been\\r\\nwell-nigh deserted at the moment of the shock. If it were nothing they\\r\\nwould still continue so. A brief time only was necessary for finding\\r\\nout. For an instant later windows were thrown open and every variety of\\r\\nheads thrust forth with eyes upturned toward the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen a fire engine rattled by and afar off a bugle call sounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat moment Dick pounded at the closed door of their house, but the\\r\\nconcierge was already awake and let him in at once. Then with a few\\r\\nbounds he cleared the steps and stood knocking at his sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bedroom\\r\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomething startling is happening, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know exactly what,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nannounced hurriedly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you girls had best get on some clothes and\\r\\ncome out. I am going up on the roof. If it is a Zeppelin raid the city\\r\\nofficials have warned people to go down to the cellars. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll let you\\r\\nknow in half a minute.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in half a minute Dick did not return. There seemed to be no danger\\r\\nfor the present at least, and besides he had a masculine contempt for\\r\\nthe length of time it takes girls to put on their clothes, even in\\r\\ntimes of emergency. Moreover, he kept staring up at the heavens too\\r\\nentranced by the spectacle to think of danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive Zeppelins were passing over Paris, the projectiles which they\\r\\ndropped in passing leaving long trails of light behind them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after a small voice spoke at Dick\\xe2\\x80\\x99s elbow: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wonderful, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nit? When I was a little girl I could never have believed that I should\\r\\nsee real fireworks like these.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout glancing around Dick naturally recognized the voice. It always\\r\\namused him to hear Barbara talk of the days when she was little, as she\\r\\nappeared so far from anything else even now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou had better go downstairs, little girl, with the other girls;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ncommanded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, it is a wonderful spectacle, but this is no place for\\r\\nyou.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen hearing her laugh lightly, he did turn around. Assuredly Barbara\\r\\ncould not go down to the other girls, since they were assembled on the\\r\\nroof with her, and not only the girls but a third of the people in the\\r\\npension. They were all talking at once in French fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\nDick felt rather helpless.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought I told you to go to the cellar,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he protested. But Barbara\\r\\npaid not the slightest attention to him and the other girls were out of\\r\\nhearing.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was clutching his left arm excitedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow they could see the aeroplanes that had come out for the defense of\\r\\nParis circling overhead and firing upon the Zeppelins and farther off\\r\\nin the distance the thunder of cannon could be heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cParis is being wonderfully good to us, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t she?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbara whispered.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe keep seeing more and more amazing things.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDick scoffed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought you pretended to be a coward, Barbara, though\\r\\nit is difficult for me to think of you as one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd to this the girl made no answer except, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe any one\\r\\nin Paris is seriously frightened. A raid is not the terrible thing\\r\\neverybody feared, at least not one like this.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Dick was not so readily convinced. There was a chance that these\\r\\nfirst air raiders were but scouts of the great army of German Zeppelins\\r\\nthat London and Paris have both been dreading since the outbreak of the\\r\\nwar.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, Dick was not alone in this idea. He could see now that the\\r\\ntops of all the large houses and hotels in the neighborhood, as far as\\r\\none could discern, were thronged with as curious a crowd as his own.\\r\\nAnd from the streets below chatter and laughter and now and then cries\\r\\nof terror or admiration floated upward.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, there were many persons in Paris that night wiser or at\\r\\nleast more prudent than the four American Red Cross girls, and there\\r\\nwere a number of places where proper precautions were taken. However,\\r\\nno one thought of going to bed again.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by the three other girls joined Barbara and Dick. But now there\\r\\nwas nothing more to be seen save the stars in the sky which were too\\r\\neternal to be appreciated. So when the noise of the cannonading had at\\r\\nlast died away, Madame Raffet, who had charge of the pension, asked her\\r\\nguests to come down into the drawing room for coffee.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls were cold and dismal now that the excitement had passed and\\r\\nwere glad enough of the invitation. Dick Thornton, however, resolutely\\r\\ndeclined to join them. He was still not in the mood for cheerful\\r\\nsociety, although he did not offer this excuse. He merely said that he\\r\\nalways had wished to see the dawn steal over Paris and here was the\\r\\nopportunity of a lifetime, since the dawn must break now in a short\\r\\nwhile.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be that Barbara Meade guessed something of her friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s humor,\\r\\nfor she went quietly away with the other girls, not joining her\\r\\nprotests with theirs over Dick\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unusual obstinacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn hour and a half passed, perhaps longer. Dick had found a seat on\\r\\na stone ledge between two tall chimney stacks. It was a long, cold\\r\\nbench and he was growing rather tired of his bargain. Still, there was\\r\\na grayness over things now and daylight must soon follow. Yet he was\\r\\nsorry he had not gone downstairs with the others; it would have been\\r\\nan easy enough business to have returned to his perch later and coffee\\r\\nwould undoubtedly have been a boon.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was kicking his feet rather more like a disconsolate small boy, who\\r\\nhad been sent upstairs to his room alone for punishment, than like a\\r\\nromantic youth about to pay tribute to his Mistress Paris, when Barbara\\r\\nMeade joined him for the second time that evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, this time he saw her coming and her welcome was far more\\r\\nenthusiastic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl had put on her long gray-blue nursing coat, but wore a\\r\\nridiculous little blue silk cap pulled down over her curls. Moreover,\\r\\nDick Thornton had to rush forward to meet her to keep her from\\r\\ntripping, since she was dragging his neglected overcoat with her and\\r\\nalso trying to carry a thick mug of coffee.\\r\\n\\r\\nDick snatched at the mug none too politely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI say, you are a trump!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he remarked with such fervor, however, that\\r\\nany girl would have forgiven him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Barbara sat down beside him on the stone ledge and after seeing\\r\\nthat he had put on the overcoat, watched him drink the coffee. She even\\r\\nadded two rolls for his refreshment from the depth of her pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI made the coffee for you myself. I think it rather good of me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nremarked placidly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe other girls are lying down. But I had a fancy\\r\\nto see the dawn over Paris myself and I thought if I brought you a\\r\\npresent you would not send me away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDick smiled, for the dawn had broken when Barbara came. From their\\r\\ntall roof they had a marvelous view of the city and the long line of\\r\\nbeautiful bridges crossing the Seine. And there, not far away, looking\\r\\nas if she were built half upon the water and half upon land, the Church\\r\\nof Notre Dame.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sudden glory of red and gold bathed its two perfect towers and the\\r\\ncross above. Slipping down between the grinning gargoyles along its\\r\\nsides it dipped into the river below. In another direction Montmartre\\r\\nwas shimmering like a rainbow, steeped in the colors and the glories of\\r\\nromance.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara shivered over the strange beauty after the excitement of the\\r\\nnight before. And although Dick was there and they were good friends,\\r\\nshe wished that one of the girls had also been her companion. It was a\\r\\ntime when she would have liked to put her hand inside a friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just\\r\\nfor the sense of warm human companionship.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Dick was not at the moment looking or thinking of her. It was\\r\\nhardly to be wondered at, the girl thought with the old grace of a\\r\\nsmile at herself. There were so many better things to see. Yet it gave\\r\\nher the chance for a farewell study of him. They were to part now in a\\r\\nshort time, for how long neither of them knew.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next instant Barbara regretted her decision. For how wretchedly\\r\\nDick Thornton was looking! Could any one believe that only a little\\r\\nover a year had passed since their first meeting on the March night\\r\\nwhen she had arrived so unceremoniously at his father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house.\\r\\nCertainly Dick had been more than kind to her even then.\\r\\n\\r\\nA moment later when Dick did chance to glance toward his companion she\\r\\nwas crying hard but silently.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce or twice before Dick had been surprised at Barbara Meade\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nunexpected tears, but now he understood them at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe offered her the comfort she had wished a little while before. Gently\\r\\nhe took her hand inside his left one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know you are thinking of me, Barbara, and this tiresome old arm of\\r\\nmine. It is tremendously kind of you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he protested. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I want you\\r\\nto promise me not to worry and to keep Mill from fretting if you can.\\r\\nI hate you girls to go off to work again without me, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made up\\r\\nmy mind to stay around Paris for a few months. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m rather glad to have\\r\\nthis chance to explain things to you. Of course, you know that when\\r\\nthat shell shattered my shoulder it seemed to paralyze my arm. Well,\\r\\nI have not given up hope that something may yet be done for it. So as\\r\\nsoon as I can get hold of one of the big surgeons here in Paris I want\\r\\nhim to have a try at me. They are fairly busy these days with people\\r\\nwho are of more account, but if I hang around long enough some one\\r\\nwill find time to look after me. You know I have never told, nor let\\r\\nMildred tell mother and father just how serious things are with me. But\\r\\nif nothing can be done I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made up my mind to go home and find out\\r\\nwhat a one-armed man can do to be useful. He isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t much good over here\\r\\nat present. You see, Barbara, I have not yet forgotten your New York\\r\\nlectures on the duty and beauty of usefulness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDick said this in a laughing voice, with no intention of attempting the\\r\\nheroic, so Barbara did her best to answer in the same spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, she had never gotten over her sense of responsibility and\\r\\nmight always continue to feel it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, I am sure something _can_ be done,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she answered, forcing herself\\r\\nto speak bravely. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut in any case you will come and say good-by to\\r\\nMill and the rest of us before you sail, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she concluded.\\r\\n\\r\\nDick nodded, but by this time they had both gotten up and were walking\\r\\nacross the roof top side by side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI say, Barbara,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dick added shyly just at the moment of parting,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chowever things turn out, promise me you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take it too seriously.\\r\\nSomehow I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say things as well as other fellows, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sorry\\r\\nI came over, in spite of this plagued arm of mine. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know why\\r\\nexactly, but this war business makes a man of one. Then when one thinks\\r\\nof what other fellows are having to give up--oh well, I read a poem by\\r\\nan Englishman who was killed the other day. Would you mind my reciting\\r\\nthe last lines to you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen taking the girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s consent for granted, Dick went on in a grave\\r\\nyoung voice that had much of the beauty which Barbara remembered in his\\r\\nsong the year before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHis name was Rupert Brooke and he wrote of the men who were going to\\r\\ndie as he did:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese laid the world away; poured out the red\\r\\n   Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be\\r\\n   Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene\\r\\n   That men call age; and those who would have been\\r\\n   Their sons, they gave--their immortality.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V _Other Fields_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe work which the American girls were to do for the French _Croix de\\r\\nRouge_ (Red Cross) was to be accomplished under entirely different\\r\\ncircumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey traveled southeast nearly an entire day and toward evening were\\r\\ndriven through a thickly wooded country to the edge of the Forest of Le\\r\\nPr\\xc3\\xaatre.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn American field hospital, an exact duplicate of those used in\\r\\nAmerica, had recently been presented to the French Government by\\r\\nthree Americans who desired that their identity be kept a secret. The\\r\\nhospital was made up of twenty tents; six of them large enough to take\\r\\ncare of two hundred wounded men. And these hospital tents could be put\\r\\nup in fifteen minutes and taken down in six by the American ambulance\\r\\nvolunteers, many of them students from Columbia, Harvard, Williams and\\r\\nother American universities.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo it was thought fitting that the four American Red Cross girls, who\\r\\nhad lately offered their services to France, should assist in the\\r\\nnursing at these new hospitals. They had been located in southern\\r\\nFrance near the lines and just beyond the reach of the enemy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guns.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore it was self-evident that different living arrangements would\\r\\nhave to be made for the nurses. So Nona, Barbara, Mildred and even\\r\\nEugenia were unfeignedly glad when they learned that they were to live\\r\\ntogether in a tiny French farmhouse within short walking distance of\\r\\nthe field hospital. There they were to do their own housekeeping, with\\r\\nthe assistance of an old man who would take charge of the outdoor work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe farmhouse had been offered for their use by the French countess\\r\\nwho was the owner of an ancient chateau about a mile away. Indeed, the\\r\\nfarmhouse lay within the boundaries of her lands.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the girls first tumbled out of the carriage they were too tired\\r\\nto be more than half-way curious over their new abode. But half an hour\\r\\nlater they were investigating the entire place with delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was because they had already rested and eaten a supper that would\\r\\nhave served for all the good little princesses in the fairy stories.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally the girls had expected to find their little house empty. But\\r\\nno sooner had they started up the cobblestone path to the blue front\\r\\ndoor when an old man appeared on the threshold, bowing with the grace\\r\\nof an eighteenth century courtier. He was only Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois, the old French\\r\\npeasant who was to be of what service he could to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere in the clean-scrubbed dining room stood a round oak table set\\r\\nwith odd pieces of china, white and blue and gold, hundreds of years\\r\\nold and more valuable than any but a connoisseur could appreciate.\\r\\n\\r\\nFran\\xc3\\xa7ois himself waited to serve supper. The Countess, whose servant\\r\\nhe had been for fifty years, had sent over the food--a pitcher of new\\r\\nmilk, a square of golden honey, _petit fromage_, which is a delicious\\r\\ncream cheese that only the French can make, and a great bowl of wild\\r\\nstrawberries, which ripen in autumn in southern France. Besides this\\r\\nthere was a big loaf of snowy bread.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara straightway threw her bonnet and coat aside. Then as she found\\r\\nthe first place at the table she exclaimed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo this is what one has to\\r\\neat in France in war times!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA few moments later Mildred took her place at what was hereafter to be\\r\\nknown as the head of the table, with Eugenia just across and Barbara\\r\\nand Nona on either side. For so almost unconsciously the little family\\r\\nof four girls arranged themselves. Although it was not until later that\\r\\nMildred Thornton was to prove the real authority in domestic matters,\\r\\nwhile Eugenia continued to regard herself as intellectual head of\\r\\nthe family, with Nona and Barbara as talented but at times tiresome\\r\\nchildren.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, after thanks and good-byes were said to old Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois, the\\r\\ngirls started on their tour of the little house. Evidently it had\\r\\nbelonged to real farmer people who must have worked some of the land\\r\\nof the countess. Doubtless the men had gone to war and the women found\\r\\nemployment elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe farmhouse was only one story and a half high, with the kitchen\\r\\nand dining room below, but above there were four small bedrooms with\\r\\na single window each and sloping ceilings. But the charming thing was\\r\\nthat the walls were of rough plaster painted in beautiful colors--one\\r\\nrose, one blue, one yellow and the other lavender.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the girls chose each the color she most loved--Barbara the blue,\\r\\nNona the pink, Mildred the lavender, and Eugenia, professing not to\\r\\ncare, the yellow.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was just about dusk when they finally came outdoors again for a\\r\\nbetter view of the house itself. They had scarcely done more than\\r\\nglanced at it on entering.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe farmhouse was built of wood which had once been white but was now a\\r\\nlight gray with the most wonderful turquoise blue door and shutters.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, the girls were to find out later that the little place was\\r\\nknown in the neighborhood roundabout as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe House with the Blue Front\\r\\nDoor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though the house was so delightful that the girls had almost\\r\\nforgotten the sadness of their errand to the country, the landscape was\\r\\nfar less cheerful.\\r\\n\\r\\nA row of poplar trees, already half stripped of their leaves, formed a\\r\\nwindbreak at one side of the house. Growing close on the farther side\\r\\nwere a dozen pine trees, suggesting gloomy sentinels left to guard the\\r\\ndeserted place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no other houses in sight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wonder where the chateau is?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbara asked a trifle wistfully. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nsuppose if our services are not required at the hospital at once we\\r\\nmight go in the morning to call on the Countess to thank her for her\\r\\nkindness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately Eugenia frowned upon the suggestion. She was a little\\r\\ndepressed by the neighborhood, now that evening was coming on, and she\\r\\nstill found it difficult to agree often with Barbara.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course we shall do no such thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she answered curtly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExchanging\\r\\nfriendly visits with new and unknown neighbors may be a western custom,\\r\\nbut so far as I have been told it is assuredly not the custom in\\r\\nFrance. Why, there are no such exclusive persons in the world as the\\r\\nold French nobility, of which this countess is a member. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you just\\r\\nimagine what she would think of the forwardness of American girls if we\\r\\nshould intrude upon her in such a fashion?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbara replied in a rather crestfallen voice as Nona put her\\r\\narm across her shoulder. Then they started into the house together. A\\r\\nlittle later, however, she regained a part of her spirit, which Eugenia\\r\\nand the coming of night had crushed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wonder, Eugenia,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she inquired in the soft tones in which she was\\r\\nmost dangerous, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow you have learned so much concerning the customs of\\r\\nthe old French nobility. Was it because you were introduced to Captain\\r\\nCastaigne the other day? I believe Lieutenant Hume said that he really\\r\\nbelonged to the aristocracy, but preferred not to use his title in\\r\\nRepublican France.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia flushed and was about to answer curtly when Mildred Thornton\\r\\ninterposed good-naturedly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor goodness sakes, children, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quarrel on our first evening, or\\r\\nyou may bring us bad luck! Remember, we have got to prove that girls\\r\\ncan live and work together. But I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to preach. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go to bed\\r\\nso we can get up early in the morning and unpack and get used to things\\r\\nabout the house. I have no doubt some one from the field hospital will\\r\\ncome over to tell us what they wish us to do. I am afraid I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nknow much about housekeeping or cooking except for the sick, but I am\\r\\ncertainly going to try and learn.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the girls went in and each one lighted a candle and retired to her\\r\\nown room.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she was nearly asleep, however, Barbara was startled by a head\\r\\nbeing thrust inside her door. Then by her flickering light she\\r\\ndiscovered Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face looking uncommonly handsome with two long\\r\\nbraids of dark hair framing her clear-cut features.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSorry I was so cross, Barbara,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she whispered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know, child,\\r\\nsometimes I feel that I must have been born an old maid.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI _The Chateau_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning Mildred and Eugenia went over the field hospital with a\\r\\nFrench officer who had been sent to receive them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara and Nona, therefore, undertook the unpacking and arranging of\\r\\ntheir belongings and also the task of preparing lunch, which was to\\r\\nbe a light one. Indeed, all the household arrangements must be of the\\r\\nsimplest, so that the girls might have their strength and enthusiasm to\\r\\ngive to the work of nursing.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut because they had gotten up soon after daylight, Nona and Barbara\\r\\nfound that they had two hours of freedom which might be spent in\\r\\ninvestigating the neighborhood. So putting on ordinary clothes instead\\r\\nof their nursing uniforms, they set out for a walk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbara suggested, making an odd grimace, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat there is\\r\\nno special harm in our walking through the estate of the countess and\\r\\npossibly looking at the chateau if we chance to be in the vicinity.\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe that we can do much strolling about here without\\r\\nencroaching on her place. From what Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois told us yesterday she owns\\r\\nmost of the countryside.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNona laughed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is possibly an exaggeration. Still, I would like\\r\\nto see the old chateau immensely. In spite of Eugenia, I agree with\\r\\nyou that we may be permitted to humbly gaze upon it without attempting\\r\\nto speak to any one. I wonder in which direction we ought to go to\\r\\ndiscover it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls had gone several yards now and Barbara stopped and wheeled\\r\\nabout.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is a pine forest over there to the left that is so lovely it\\r\\nwon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter if it brings us out at the end of nowhere. Only we ought\\r\\nto drop bits of paper behind us like Hop o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 My Thumb for fear of\\r\\ngetting lost.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have a fairly good bump of locality,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the other girl answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen in spite of the fact that they were two feminine persons, neither\\r\\nof the girls spoke again until they had walked at least a mile. Having\\r\\ncome unexpectedly upon a shining pool of water, it was then impossible\\r\\nnot to utter exclamations of delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nNona dropped down on her knees and stared into the depth of it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave\\r\\nyou read \\xe2\\x80\\x98Peleas and Melisande,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Barbara?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt opens in the\\r\\nmost exquisite fashion with Melisande gazing down into the depth of the\\r\\npool and crying over something she has lost. One never knows exactly\\r\\nwhat it is, but I always thought the entire story meant a reaching\\r\\nafter the light. I suppose that is what war is, though it is a cruel\\r\\nand horrible way of searching for it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara nodded, although she did not know exactly what her friend was\\r\\ntalking about. There was a poetic streak in Nona Davis that no other\\r\\none of the four girls possessed. During her lonely childhood she seemed\\r\\nto have read an odd assortment of books. Of course she had not the real\\r\\ninformation that Eugenia had, but what she knew was more fascinating,\\r\\nat least according to Barbara Meade\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I hope that war may never cross the border line into these\\r\\nforests,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nona added thoughtfully, \\xe2\\x80\\x9calthough I can imagine any one who\\r\\nknew them could play hide and seek with an enemy for a long time. There\\r\\nis a little hut over there that seems deserted; let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go and see it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Barbara had been standing she of course had a better view than her\\r\\ncompanion, but Nona obediently followed her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little hut was empty. It was merely a tumbledown shack of logs\\r\\nand stones. However, some one must have inhabited it at one time or\\r\\nanother, because there were signs of a fire and a few old pots and\\r\\npans, weather beaten and rusty, that had been left about. Moreover,\\r\\nthere was a moth-eaten fur rug that may have formed a bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet it was lonely and uncomfortable looking, so the girls did not care\\r\\nto linger. Besides, if they were to see the old French chateau during\\r\\nthe morning they must find a place where it was more likely to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiscovering a path that appeared to have been more used than any other,\\r\\nthey followed it. In ten minutes after they came to the edge of the\\r\\nclearing and there about a quarter of a mile beyond was the outline of\\r\\nthe chateau.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose it is intruding to go nearer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbara said plaintively,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get the least satisfaction from this bird\\xe2\\x80\\x99s-eye view.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo doubt of it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nona answered, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyet I propose that we take the risk.\\r\\nThese are war times and very few servants are left about any of the old\\r\\nplaces, so we may escape without being seen. I feel it is our duty, as\\r\\nlong as Eugenia is not along, to see all that we can before our work\\r\\nbegins. Then we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have no chance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chateau was in a measure a disappointment, because after all it\\r\\nlooked more like an old-time fortress than a dwelling house, and\\r\\nbesides was dreadfully dilapidated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut once one was accustomed to this idea, it really became more\\r\\ninteresting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nona finally argued.\\r\\n\\r\\nA part of the chateau must have been erected in the fourteenth or\\r\\nfifteenth century when feudal warfare was still carried on in France.\\r\\nThe stone tower had loopholes for windows with iron bars across, so\\r\\nthat the approach of an enemy could be discovered and he might be\\r\\nattacked with slight danger to the inmates of the castle. This tower\\r\\nwas in a fairly good state of preservation, but the rest of the house,\\r\\nwhere the living apartments were situated, was almost a ruin. There\\r\\nwere signs of poverty everywhere. The servants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 quarters were deserted,\\r\\nthere were no stables, nothing to suggest the prosperity that should\\r\\naccompany so famous a possession as the old chateau represented.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, the two American girls were so engaged in discussing the\\r\\nsituation that they were not aware of anyone approaching. Unexpectedly\\r\\nthey found a woman past middle age moving slowly toward them. She was\\r\\nalone save that she was accompanied by an immense silver-gray dog,\\r\\nwhich to Nona\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gratification she held by a leash. For in spite of\\r\\nher bravery in other matters, Nona was ridiculously and unreasonably\\r\\nfearful of dogs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGracious!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbara whispered, half amused and half terror-stricken.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat must be the mythical countess herself. Shades of Eugenia, what\\r\\nshall we say or do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the older woman gave them little opportunity for a decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was small and slender, dressed in black, with a lace shawl over her\\r\\nhead coming down into a point upon her forehead. Underneath were masses\\r\\nof carefully arranged snow-white hair. The Countess\\xe2\\x80\\x99 face was almost as\\r\\nwhite as her hair; there was nothing that gave it color save her lips\\r\\nand a pair of somber dark eyes. Her expression was sad and aloof.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe must have recognized the two girls as Americans and known for what\\r\\npurpose they had just come to the neighborhood. Nevertheless, she\\r\\npassed by them without speaking, save for a slight inclination of her\\r\\nhead. In spite of her kindness the evening before, assuredly she had no\\r\\ndesire for further acquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she was out of hearing Barbara and Nona gazed at each other like\\r\\ntwo forward children.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Barbara took off the small silk cap she was so fond of wearing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am taking it off to Eugenia, Nona,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank fortune, I\\r\\ndid not intrude my western personality upon the great lady. I can just\\r\\nimagine how she would have treated me if I had undertaken to thank her\\r\\nfor her kindness and what she would have thought about American girls\\r\\nin general. Eugenia put it mildly. Well, as a greater person than I\\r\\nam once remarked, \\xe2\\x80\\x98it takes all kinds of people to make a world.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And\\r\\nmethinks before this war nursing experience is over we shall have met\\r\\na good many varieties. But let us get back to the little blue and gray\\r\\nfarmhouse as soon as possible. Goodness knows, I would rather live\\r\\nin it than in a tumble-down chateau! Besides, I wish to apologize to\\r\\nEugenia.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the girls had only started on their return journey when some\\r\\none came hobbling along behind them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois and he carried a basket on his arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nNona inquired a shorter way home and the old man explained that as\\r\\nhe was on the way to their house, he would like to be permitted to\\r\\naccompany them. There was a road that was only half as long as the\\r\\nroute they had taken.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally the girls were glad enough for the old man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s escort,\\r\\nespecially as he was full of reminiscences of the neighborhood which he\\r\\nloved dearly to impart.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his basket was another offering from the countess. Old Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois\\r\\nexplained that if she had passed them without seeming to notice their\\r\\npresence, it was not that she intended being unkind. She was lonely and\\r\\ndepressed. All her kinspeople were at the front as well as her only\\r\\nson, who was the last to bear the family name. Moreover, they had been\\r\\npoor before, but now that all their farm people had gone off to the war\\r\\nand there was no one left to work in the fields, where was a single\\r\\nfranc to come from? Besides, were not the Germans so near the line that\\r\\nif the worst took place they would overrun the countryside and destroy\\r\\nthe little that was left?\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally the girls discovered that the old man and his mistress were\\r\\nactually the only two persons remaining in the old chateau. When\\r\\nFran\\xc3\\xa7ois was compelled to be away the countess had only her great dog\\r\\nfor protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe picture was a pathetic one and Nona and Barbara felt less aggrieved\\r\\nby the older woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coldness. One could hardly wonder that she did not\\r\\ncare to meet or talk to strangers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you afraid to be here on this great place alone, Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nNona asked, more to persuade the old man to go on talking than because\\r\\nshe was interested in her question.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old peasant shook his head enigmatically. But he was a garrulous\\r\\nold fellow and immensely pleased with Nona\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to speak French.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will be in no danger,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, bobbing his head and then shrugging\\r\\nhis old shoulders until all his bent-over body seemed to be moving at\\r\\nonce, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceven if the barbarians should devastate our land. If this should\\r\\nhappen the American girls must flee to old Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois for protection.\\r\\nThey could say what they liked about the Red Cross insuring them from\\r\\ndanger, he knew a better way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But what the way was Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois would not\\r\\ntell, although both girls teased and implored him to confide in them\\r\\nall the way back to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHouse with the Blue Front Door.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII _Nicolete_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the following week the four girls were too busy to think of\\r\\nanything save their hospital work and their household responsibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one afternoon about four o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock one of their officer friends\\r\\nsuggested that they pay a visit to the French line of trenches in\\r\\ntheir immediate neighborhood. Not the firing line, but the second line\\r\\ntrenches where the reserve soldiers slept, ate, smoked their cigarettes\\r\\nand even edited a daily paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some little time there had been a lull in the fighting, so there\\r\\ncould be little danger in such a tour of inspection. Yet if there had\\r\\nbeen, the Red Cross girls would have given it scant thought. They were\\r\\nbecoming so accustomed to the conditions of war that even Barbara\\r\\nMeade confessed herself a little less of a coward. Indeed, they were\\r\\nbeginning to understand why many soldiers take their daily existence so\\r\\ncalmly and cheerfully, until actually they are bored, or homesick, or\\r\\nboth, unless fighting is going on or the prospects of it near.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrenches, you probably know, are not arranged in parallel lines, the\\r\\none exactly behind the other like long pieces of ribbon. They often\\r\\nform a series of intricate underground passages, some of them crossing\\r\\nand recrossing each other, so that in one battle front in France where\\r\\nthere were one hundred and forty miles of trenches there were only\\r\\ntwelve miles directly facing the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally the Red Cross girls could only see a very small section of\\r\\ntrench life during one afternoon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s visit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut the briefness of the excursion was the chief thing to recommend\\r\\nit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbara Meade insisted afterwards, although interested at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing their soldier guide, the girls walked through a deep, wide\\r\\ntunnel with a wooden paving at the bottom, such as one used to see in\\r\\nold-time village streets.\\r\\n\\r\\nInside the light was dim and gray, broken by shafts of sunlight\\r\\nfiltering down through flimsy roofs of straw and branches of trees,\\r\\nplaced above the openings to conceal the French trenches from the\\r\\nGerman air scouts.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia and Nona kept together at first with Barbara and Mildred close\\r\\nbehind them. Every few feet of the way, however, one or all four of\\r\\nthem would stop for conversation with the French soldiers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the men there were several who had made pathetic efforts to turn\\r\\ntheir mole-like quarters into semblances of homes. One young fellow had\\r\\nactually swung a faded photograph of his mother upon a wooden peg which\\r\\nhe had hammered into the earth. So \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMa M\\xc3\\xa8re\\xe2\\x80\\x9d had become the mascot of\\r\\nhis trench. Because of her presence, the other soldier declared, not\\r\\none German shell had fallen into their ditch.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, many good Catholics had iron or wooden crosses suspended\\r\\nabove the small heap of possessions each soldier was allowed to keep in\\r\\nhis trench. These were his knapsack and rifle, sometimes a few papers\\r\\nand magazines, perhaps a writing pad and pencil and a small roll of\\r\\nfirst-aid appliances presented by the French Red Cross Society.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf necessity a soldier\\xe2\\x80\\x99s existence inside a trench must be a quiet\\r\\none. Many of them are compelled to turn night into day, so they sleep\\r\\nwhile the light shines and stay on guard at night when there is always\\r\\ngreater danger of attack. However, as it was late afternoon when the\\r\\nRed Cross girls made their tour of inspection, it was about the time\\r\\nthe soldiers enjoyed their recreation. Only the sentries appeared to be\\r\\ndoing active duty. Many of the other men were smoking or joking with\\r\\none another, some of them were even drinking afternoon tea after the\\r\\nfashion they had acquired from the English Tommies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the four American girls, preceded by their guide, approached,\\r\\nwalking along through the center of the trench as if they were on a\\r\\ncity street, first the soldiers stared at them with surprise and then\\r\\nwith pleasure. It was an odd sight to see a petticoat in such a place!\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally the soldiers wished to shake hands with their guests, to ask\\r\\nquestions about their wounded comrades, and in many cases to tell them\\r\\nhow they had conquered the difficulties in their underground existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet how differently the four girls were affected by the experience!\\r\\nBarbara Meade felt extraordinarily depressed. Even if the soldiers did\\r\\nmake the best of things, she could not help thinking that many of them\\r\\nwere just young boys who ought to have been whistling and working in\\r\\nthe sunshine, or else studying or playing upon college grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nMildred also found it difficult to behave as cheerfully as she would\\r\\nhave liked. However, Nona and Eugenia were really too entertained by\\r\\nwhat they saw and heard to reflect upon anything save the wonder of the\\r\\nscene about them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American girls were at present nursing in that portion of France\\r\\nwhere the trench system has been known to the outside world as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe\\r\\nLabyrinth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d so intricate and maze-line are its passageways.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was almost at the end of their journey when Barbara Meade made a\\r\\ndiscovery that in some odd fashion made a stronger appeal to her than\\r\\nany of the wonders they had seen. Their trip had of course been made\\r\\nthrough one of the rear trenches at some distance from the German line.\\r\\nNow they had come to the last ditch they were to be allowed to enter.\\r\\nIt was less deep than the others and sloped gradually to the earth\\r\\nabove. Moreover, the light now shone more distinctly, so that just at\\r\\nfirst the girls were a little blinded after the darkness. It was always\\r\\nperpetual twilight in the deeper trenches until night fell.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara stood for a moment with her eyelids fluttering and a curiously\\r\\nintense expression on her face. Then she reached out her hand and\\r\\ntouched Mildred Thornton, who chanced at the instant to be nearest her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she whispered. Then without finishing her\\r\\nsentence she wrinkled up her small nose in an absurd fashion, sniffing\\r\\nthe heavy underground air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose our trip has gone to my head,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she murmured, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut do you\\r\\nknow I thought I just smelt a delicious odor of flowers. Do you suppose\\r\\nit is because the air here is different?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia also sniffed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFlowers!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she repeated indignantly, overhearing\\r\\nthe remark. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReally, Barbara, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see how you can manage to be\\r\\nfoolish so many times.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nevertheless, she slipped her arm inside the\\r\\nyounger girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, noticing that she looked pale and tired.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this time the officer who had been acting as their escort moved on\\r\\nahead with Nona and Mildred following him.\\r\\n\\r\\nA second later and Eugenia also stopped, arching her thin nostrils.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor there standing just in front of Barbara was an unexpected figure.\\r\\nHe was a boy of about nineteen. But instead of having the dark hair and\\r\\neyes of most young Frenchmen, he was blond, with pale gold hair, blue\\r\\neyes and the faintest down of a future moustache. Moreover, he held\\r\\na bunch of old-fashioned flowers in his hand, which he was thrusting\\r\\ntoward the two strange young women.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere, I did know what I was talking about, after all!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbara\\r\\nejaculated faintly to her companion. However, Eugenia had a habit of\\r\\npaying no attention to one when she chanced to be in the wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she remarked graciously to the young soldier as she\\r\\naccepted his flowers, for Eugenia could be gracious when she chose.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut do tell how you managed to find a bouquet at such a time and\\r\\nplace?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was speaking her best school French, but in spite of her peculiar\\r\\naccent the soldier somehow managed to understand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOut of my _own_ garden,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied, with a faint lifting of the blond\\r\\nmustache.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young soldier looked like a grown-up baby, Barbara thought, with\\r\\nhis fair curly hair, his pink cheeks and his china-blue eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou see there are long hours here in the trenches when we men have so\\r\\nlittle to do, one suffers the _grand ennui_,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained to Eugenia.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo my friends and I have made a garden. If you have a minute more to\\r\\nspare will you come and see?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nObediently the two girls followed until the soldier led them to the\\r\\nopening in the trench that led up to the outside world. Already Nona\\r\\nand Mildred and the young officer had disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there like a sunken garden about four feet below the earth were two\\r\\nbeds of bright old-fashioned flowers and small stunted evergreens. The\\r\\ngardeners had left a pathway of earth in the center of the trench, just\\r\\nas one might in any ordinary garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara rubbed her eyes. She was pretending to be overcome with\\r\\nsurprise, but in reality felt the tears coming. For some reason she\\r\\ncould not explain it struck her as terribly pathetic that the soldiers,\\r\\nhiding in these trenches for such tragic work, should spend their spare\\r\\nhours making the dark world beautiful.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia was bent upon understanding the situation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid you actually plant seeds here in such a place and under such\\r\\nconditions and make them grow?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she demanded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhatever made you think\\r\\nthey would blossom?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French soldier smiled. He seemed rather to enjoy the questioning,\\r\\nsince it showed the proper interest and admiration for his work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI brought back the first plant from our garden when I had been at\\r\\nhome on sick leave,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained proudly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen without thinking\\r\\nor expecting the flower to live, I thrust my plant into the earth\\r\\nwhere there was a little sunlight. Then the _pauvre petite_ grew and\\r\\nflourished and so I wrote home for others. Later my comrades grew\\r\\ninterested. They brought water for my plants and saved their tobacco\\r\\nashes to put around them. Then they too asked that more plants be sent\\r\\nthem. Some we found by the wayside in our walks through the woods. We\\r\\nhave been lucky because no German shell has dared destroy our garden.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young fellow looked so pleased that even Eugenia, who was far less\\r\\nsentimental than Barbara, felt touched. It might be ridiculous to\\r\\nspend one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time tending a garden when there was so much more important\\r\\nwork to be done, but then the French are an artistic and a sentimental\\r\\npeople. One had read of the soldiers in the trenches planting gardens\\r\\nin their spare hours without really believing it until now.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Eugenia was impatient to be gone. The other three girls expected\\r\\nto return home immediately, but she wished first to pay a short visit\\r\\nto the field hospital back of the trenches to inquire about one of her\\r\\npatients.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, when once they were safe upon the face of the earth again,\\r\\nboth girls uttered exclamations of surprise. But neither of them\\r\\nshowed the least desire to move away. For there just ahead of them was\\r\\na stretch of level green country with about fifty soldiers forming a\\r\\ncircle within it. They were not lounging or talking, but were alert and\\r\\ninterested. They were watching something or someone who must be in the\\r\\ncenter of the circle.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara and Eugenia discovered that Nona and Mildred had joined the\\r\\ngroup. They were equally absorbed. Indeed, when the two girls joined\\r\\nthem, Barbara had to stand on tiptoe to find out what was going on.\\r\\nNeither of her friends paid the slightest attention to her. Indeed, it\\r\\nwas only through the kindness of a soldier who moved aside to make room\\r\\nfor her and Eugenia that they were able to see what was taking place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere in the middle of the green space was such an entrancing figure\\r\\nthat Barbara fairly gasped with surprise and pleasure. Eugenia frowned\\r\\nwith a mixture of disapproval and interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nA girl of about fifteen or sixteen was dancing for the entertainment of\\r\\nthe soldiers. She was slender, with straight black hair, loose to her\\r\\nshoulders. On her head was a scarlet cap and she wore a thin blouse and\\r\\na short skirt the color of her cap. As she whirled about in her dance\\r\\nnow and then she would snatch the cap from her head. Then the girls\\r\\ncould see that she seemed to bend and sway almost without effort. Her\\r\\neyes were large and dark and her lips a bright red, yet in spite of\\r\\nthe exercise of the dance her cheeks remained pale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is like a poppy dancing in the wind, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t she, Eugenia?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbara\\r\\nwhispered admiringly.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia looked severe. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must say I cannot approve of such an\\r\\nexhibition,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she commented.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor once Barbara agreed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t _approve_ either, but the girl is\\r\\nentrancing. I wonder who she is and what her name can be? The soldiers\\r\\nbehave as if she had danced for them before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment Barbara heard a voice at her elbow and turning\\r\\ndiscovered the young Frenchman who had presented them the bunch of\\r\\nflowers.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis pink cheeks were pinker than ever and his eyes bluer. Once again\\r\\nBarbara decided that he was a glorified, grown-up baby. He held a\\r\\nlittle spray of mignonette in his hand which he tossed toward the\\r\\nlittle dancer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is Nicolete,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he whispered excitedly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt least that is what I\\r\\nhave chosen to call her. No one knows who she is or where she comes\\r\\nfrom, only that she dances for us here nearly every afternoon at this\\r\\nhour.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII _Who Goes There?_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia stayed later at the hospital than she expected. The patient she\\r\\nhad left a few hours before was not so well and wished her to be with\\r\\nhim. So she sat holding the boy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand and talking to him gently until\\r\\nhe had fallen asleep. It was curious that Eugenia, who was always so\\r\\nstern with well persons, was wonderfully sympathetic with her patients.\\r\\nShe was firm, of course, but only when she felt it necessary for their\\r\\ngood. For Eugenia was not a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbutterfly\\xe2\\x80\\x9d nurse, the name that has been\\r\\napplied to the fashionable society women who have been caring for the\\r\\nwounded as much for their own entertainment as the soldiers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 good.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo somehow, in spite of her American French, the boy she had\\r\\nbeen tending preferred her to remain by him rather than his own\\r\\ncountrywoman.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was very tired when she slipped away. She had come to the field\\r\\nhospital at eight o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock in the morning, worked until four, then spent\\r\\ntwo hours in the trenches and afterwards another two hours at nursing\\r\\nagain. For it was after eight o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock when she started for home.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally no one appreciated that Eugenia was returning alone. Of\\r\\ncourse, in war times the Red Cross nurses had grown accustomed to\\r\\ncaring for themselves as well as other persons. Nevertheless, this\\r\\nevening the circumstances were unusual. Eugenia was a stranger in a\\r\\nstrange land. She had only recently come to this portion of France,\\r\\nwas unfamiliar with the country, which was filled with regiments of\\r\\nsoldiers. Moreover, the night was uncomfortably dark. Had the doctors\\r\\nor attendants at the field hospital known of her departure, one of them\\r\\nwould have insisted upon accompanying her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, no one is sensible when tired. So for some reason, although a\\r\\nlittle nervous at the prospect ahead of her, Eugenia got away without\\r\\nbeing seen. She was determined to give no trouble. Of course, if she\\r\\nhad been Barbara, or Nona, or Mildred she would have considered it\\r\\nfool-hardy, almost wicked, to have attempted walking a mile in the\\r\\ndarkness alone. But with Eugenia Peabody the case was different. No one\\r\\nhad ever thought of looking after her in her life, and surely no one\\r\\nwould begin now.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first part of her trip home was along a path through the open\\r\\nfields. As Eugenia hurried on toward their little adopted home she\\r\\nbegan wondering if the girls had missed her at supper time. This was\\r\\nthe pleasantest hour in all their day. Then possibly because she was\\r\\nweary she decided that they had probably been glad to be relieved of\\r\\nher presence. For no one of the American Red Cross girls really cared\\r\\nmuch for her. Of this Eugenia was convinced. Nona and Mildred both\\r\\ntried to be kind and Barbara behaved as well as she could, except on\\r\\noccasions when she felt especially antagonistic.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce or twice Eugenia stumbled, not because there were difficulties\\r\\nin her way but because she was thinking so deeply. What could be the\\r\\ntrouble with her nature? As she was in a mood of severe truthfulness\\r\\nwith herself she realized that no one had ever loved her a great deal\\r\\nin her entire life.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeft an orphan when she was a few years old, she could not recall her\\r\\nmother or father. Of course, her Aunt Rebecca, who had brought her up,\\r\\nhad been reasonably fond of her. But Eugenia was convinced that she had\\r\\nnever been an attractive child.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet why, tonight of all nights, should she fall to thinking of herself?\\r\\nAnd why in this darkness and in a foreign land should she have such a\\r\\nclear vision of the little girl in the old New England town?\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing she recalled most distinctly: she must have always looked\\r\\nold. Strangers used to discuss her and people used always to expect\\r\\nmore from her than from the other children of the same age. Moreover,\\r\\nshe had always been painfully shy and this shyness had colored her\\r\\nwhole life.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a child she simply had to pretend to feel superior and to be\\r\\nserious-minded, because she did not know how to play and laugh like\\r\\nthe others did. Since she had been grown up, and for the same reason,\\r\\nshe had gone on behaving in the same way.\\r\\n\\r\\nOften here in Europe with the other Red Cross girls she had wished to\\r\\nbe as gay and nonsensical as they were. Yet she never knew how to relax\\r\\ninto a frivolous mood.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the tears actually started into Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dark eyes. She realized\\r\\nthat now and then she had even been jealous of her three companions.\\r\\nNona and Barbara were so pretty and charming and Mildred had qualities\\r\\nfiner than these two possessions. Besides, the three girls made her\\r\\nfeel so dreadfully old. This is never an agreeable sensation after\\r\\ntwenty, however much the teens may aspire to appear elderly. Then\\r\\nEugenia managed to smile at herself, although it was a kind of twisted\\r\\nsmile. It occurred to her to wonder if she had failed to like Barbara\\r\\nMeade because it was Barbara who had first suggested that she must be a\\r\\ngreat deal older than the rest of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeliberately Eugenia now began to walk slowly. She did not wish to\\r\\narrive at home in her present mood. Having passed through the fields,\\r\\nshe was now on her way through the lane that led through an open woods\\r\\ndirectly to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHouse with the Blue Front Door.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dozens of times\\r\\nEugenia had made this trip in the daytime, but a country road has a\\r\\nvery different appearance at night. Moreover, the trees made the lane\\r\\nseem far darker than the path through the open fields.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was stupid not to have brought her electric flashlight! However,\\r\\nnothing had so far disturbed Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s progress. Not one wayfarer or\\r\\nsoldier out upon leave had she encountered, although the neighborhood\\r\\nwas thickly populated with men and women living on the outskirts of the\\r\\nentrenchments.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia hoped that if she should meet a passerby he might be a soldier.\\r\\nThere were but few of them who would not respect her uniform. However,\\r\\nshe was beginning to forget her previous nervousness, for this lane was\\r\\nnot a frequently traveled one. It merely led past their little house\\r\\ninto the heavier woods beyond, where Barbara and Nona had told of their\\r\\ndiscovery of the deserted hut and the pool of Melisande.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no moon and Eugenia was making little noise. She had a\\r\\nfashion of being able to get about almost soundlessly, a characteristic\\r\\nshe had cultivated in the sick room until she could move almost as\\r\\nquietly as an Indian.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen suddenly she began to feel more sensible and cheerful. Home was no\\r\\nlonger far away and even if no one loved her very devotedly, at least\\r\\nthe girls would have saved supper for her. Food would go a long way\\r\\ntoward dispelling her blues.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnconsciously Eugenia was moving more rapidly. She had almost broken\\r\\ninto a run before she became aware of footsteps behind her. Then,\\r\\nalthough pausing for about half a second to find out, she could not\\r\\ndecide whether one or half a dozen persons were following her.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was most unreasonable of Eugenia. She had no cause for thinking\\r\\nthat the presence of other persons traveling the same lane meant\\r\\nthey were in pursuit of her. But have you ever given way to an attack\\r\\nof melancholy? Then you know that invariably it leaves your nerves\\r\\nunstrung and ready for a collapse.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly Eugenia did not consider herself beautiful or attractive,\\r\\nyet even in the midst of her self-depreciation she had not thought to\\r\\nbewail her own lack of judgment. Nevertheless, almost at once after\\r\\nhearing the steps she started to run. This was, of course, the most\\r\\nridiculous thing she could have done. A moment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thought and she must\\r\\nhave appreciated the fact. These were war times and the suggestion that\\r\\none wished to escape a pursuer was in itself a sign of guilt.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately Eugenia increased her speed, at the same instant the\\r\\npersons or things behind her gave chase. The next moment a voice rang\\r\\nout. Something it said in French which held a tone of authority.\\r\\nHowever, Eugenia paid it not the slightest attention. Only a quarter of\\r\\na mile beyond lay \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe House with the Blue Front Door,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d so her one idea\\r\\nnow was to reach it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBarbara! Barbara!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Eugenia called faintly, though just why she should\\r\\nhave endeavored to summon the smallest and apparently the most timid of\\r\\nthe Red Cross girls, far be it from Eugenia to understand either then\\r\\nor afterwards. Fright sometimes makes one do extraordinary things.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut imagine the stately Eugenia running through the night with her\\r\\nnurse\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coat forming a kind of sail behind her, her bonnet in her hand\\r\\nand her heavy hair unbound and falling down her neck, crying out to\\r\\nBarbara for protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Barbara herself could not have run faster, for now Eugenia had real\\r\\ncause for fear. A great something was pounding nearer and nearer her.\\r\\nThe sound it made was scarcely human. Then again a voice shouted a few\\r\\nwords sharply in French. In her terror Eugenia could not comprehend\\r\\ntheir meaning. Nevertheless, she must have hesitated for an instant,\\r\\nfor immediately after something struck her on either shoulder. Falling,\\r\\nshe was thus unable to see what had happened, but remained mute with\\r\\nthe horror. The tremendous thing still hovered over her so that she\\r\\ndared not speak or move.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally an eternity seemed to have passed over Eugenia. However, it\\r\\nwas only another moment before a light flashed in her face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSacre c\\xc5\\x93ur!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she heard a voice exclaim. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUne femme!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the great creature that had pinned her down moved away and Eugenia\\r\\nfelt a hand upon her arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI beg a thousand pardons,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a voice said in English. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou will never be\\r\\nable to forgive me. But why did you not halt when I called out to you?\\r\\nI am a French officer and feared you were a runaway soldier or a thief.\\r\\nThey come now and then to our camp. But that I should allow you to be\\r\\nstruck down by my dog! Monsieur le Duc, I am most bitterly ashamed of\\r\\nyou. You at least should have known better.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis last remark was addressed to the dog, in order to gain time and to\\r\\nhelp cover the young French officer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chagrin and confusion. With his\\r\\nlight he had of course discovered that Eugenia was wearing a nurse\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nuniform, which made his act the more unpardonable. Nevertheless, as he\\r\\napologized he was struggling to help her to arise.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time Eugenia was more or less herself again and moreover was\\r\\nexceedingly angry. She was frightened and hurt by her experience, but\\r\\nmore, her dignity was upset as it had never been before.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia disdained the French officer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assistance. Quickly as possible\\r\\nshe got up on her feet, though still unable to speak because of a queer\\r\\ncontraction in her throat and odd shaking of her knees. One glance\\r\\nshe deigned to give at the great beast that had so frightened her.\\r\\nShe could only see the outline of an immense dog, that appeared as\\r\\napologetic as the man since his master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rebuke. But Eugenia would not\\r\\nlook at the young officer. However, it would have done little good, for\\r\\nshe could not have seen him with any distinctness in the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet Eugenia would have been both amazed and annoyed if she had dreamed\\r\\nof how clearly the offender could see her. He had managed to turn his\\r\\nflashlight upon her in such a way that he had a perfect vision of her\\r\\nwithout being seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nCuriously Eugenia was looking unusually handsome. Her cheeks were\\r\\nbrilliantly flushed and her dark eyes glowing with a mixture of\\r\\nemotions. Moreover, she had beautiful hair when it was unbound,\\r\\nalthough few people realized it after she had twisted it into a tight\\r\\nrope to adorn her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI presume your mistake was unintentional,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she remarked in an icy\\r\\nvoice, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut please in future be more careful of the victims of your\\r\\nmistakes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSurely Eugenia had forgotten that she was speaking to an officer in\\r\\nthe French army, for her tone was that of a severe elder addressing\\r\\nan erring child. She did not at present know the officer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rank, age\\r\\nnor condition of life. But one is by no means sure that any possible\\r\\nconsideration would have influenced Eugenia in her present mood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I prefer to find my way home alone,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she continued in answer to\\r\\nher companion\\xe2\\x80\\x99s humble request to accompany her.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Eugenia walked on with her head very high for the rest of the\\r\\njourney, pretending not to know that the officer and his dog were\\r\\nkeeping at a respectful distance in order to afford her a safe escort.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was scarcely necessary \\xe2\\x80\\x9cafter the pot was in the fire,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Eugenia\\r\\nthought, recalling an old New England expression. She was no longer\\r\\nfrightened now that she could see the light in their own little French\\r\\nfarmhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet to the surprise and consternation of the three American Red Cross\\r\\ngirls, Eugenia burst into tears the moment Barbara had opened the blue\\r\\nfront door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX _A Conversation_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia sat in an old oak chair in the farmhouse dining room while\\r\\nBarbara swept and dusted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the morning after her experience in the woods and actually she\\r\\nhad confessed to a headache and had decided not to go to the field\\r\\nhospital for her daily nursing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt present the four American girls were on day duty and remained at the\\r\\nhospital from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, their\\r\\nplaces being taken by other nurses at that hour. But each girl had one\\r\\nday of rest and by chance this happened to be Barbara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia had been asleep when Nona and Mildred went away to work and\\r\\nonly in the last half hour had crept downstairs. All her life every\\r\\nnow and then she had been subject to wretched headaches which left her\\r\\nspeechless and exhausted. But so far since coming abroad her three\\r\\ngirl companions had not been aware of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow every now and then while Barbara worked she glanced toward Eugenia.\\r\\nIt was difficult to recognize the severe and energetic Miss Peabody in\\r\\nthis white-faced, quiet girl. For Eugenia had never since the beginning\\r\\nof their acquaintance looked so young. For one thing, she was wearing a\\r\\nbeautiful violet cashmere kimono Mildred had presented her during their\\r\\nstay in Paris. She had never worn it until now. At least the gift had\\r\\nnot come directly from Mildred or Eugenia would never have accepted it.\\r\\nBut Mrs. Thornton had written from New York asking that Mildred\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new\\r\\nfriends receive some little gifts from her, and Mildred had chosen four\\r\\nkimonos. They were too pretty for nursing use, so the other girls had\\r\\nbeen enjoying theirs in the evenings alone at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia had never consented to relax even to that extent when work was\\r\\nover and there was no possibility of company. Now, however, her costume\\r\\nwas not of her own choosing, for after Barbara had taken a cup of\\r\\ncoffee to her room and persuaded her into drinking it, she had dressed\\r\\nher in the new kimono without asking permission. Also she had brushed\\r\\nand plaited Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heavy hair into two long braids.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFunny for a New England old maid to be able to look like an Italian\\r\\nMadonna simply because her hair is down and her head aches,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbara\\r\\nthought to herself after one of her quick glances at Eugenia.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe made rather a fetching picture herself, but Barbara was at present\\r\\nentirely unconscious. Simply because it happened to be the most useful\\r\\ncostume she owned for the purpose, she was clad in a French peasant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nsmock of dark-blue linen, and wore a little white cap at a rakish angle\\r\\non top of her brown curls. Her hair was now sufficiently long to twist\\r\\ninto a small knot at the nape of her neck, where delicate tendrils were\\r\\napt to creep forth like the new growth on a vine.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally Eugenia, opening her eyes and catching sight of Barbara, at\\r\\nthis moment on tip toes in her effort to dust the tall mantel-shelf,\\r\\nsaid unexpectedly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are very pretty, Barbara dear, and just the kind of a little woman\\r\\nthat men are apt to care for. I wonder if you ever think of marrying,\\r\\nor do you mean to go on nursing all your life? Now and then I have\\r\\nthought that Dick----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut her sentence was interrupted by Barbara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dropping the candlestick\\r\\nwhich she was dusting and then turning to stare at her companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, Eugenia, I thought you were asleep,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she began reproachfully.\\r\\nThen showing the dimple which she so resented, she added slyly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut\\r\\nwhat on earth made you speak on such a subject? I never dreamed that\\r\\nyou ever had a thought of such a thing in your life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara bit her lips. No wonder Eugenia considered her a goose, for\\r\\ncertainly she seemed possessed of the fatal gift of saying the wrong\\r\\nthing.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia was no longer pale. Indeed, a wave of hot color had turned her\\r\\nentire face crimson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAm I so unattractive as all that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked slowly, forgetting her\\r\\nheadache for the instant and feeling a return of the mood that had\\r\\ntroubled her the evening before, until the excitement of her adventure\\r\\nhad driven it from her mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you know, Barbara, I was trying to decide just last night what was\\r\\nthe matter with me. Now I know you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like me, but I think you are\\r\\nfair. Tell me why you suppose I have never even thought of love and\\r\\nmarriage and the kind of happiness other girls expect. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not so very\\r\\nold, after all! But you are right in one idea. I never, never have\\r\\ndreamed of it for myself. For one thing, no one has ever been in love\\r\\nwith me even the least little bit in all my life!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of the tactlessness of Barbara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech actually Eugenia was\\r\\nspeaking without the least temper, when ordinarily she was given to\\r\\nshowing anger with her companion under the slightest provocation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn consequence Barbara felt entirely disgusted with herself, and what\\r\\nwas worse--ridiculously tongue-tied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, I did not mean anything like that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she stammered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is--at\\r\\nleast--why, of course you are as nice as anyone when you let yourself\\r\\nbe, Eugenia. But you do seem cold, as if you considered other people\\r\\nnot exactly worth your attention. And--and----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNot feeling that she was making out a very good case for herself,\\r\\nBarbara put her duster down and came and sat on a wooden stool near the\\r\\nolder girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am an idiot, Eugenia,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she insisted scornfully. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo wonder Dick\\r\\nThornton always declares I have never grown up. Besides, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nbelieve you have never had any one in love with you, not even a young\\r\\ngirl-and-boy affair. No girl ever lives to be as old as you are\\r\\nwithout----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain Barbara stopped short, biting her lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Eugenia only shook her head and laughed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am the exception that\\r\\nproves the rule. Besides, my dear, you came from the west and not\\r\\nNew England, and you weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, as people have so often said of me,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98born an old maid.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 But never mind, I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask any more embarrassing\\r\\nquestions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia tried to speak lightly, half amused and half hurt by the\\r\\nexpression of chagrin on Barbara Meade\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added, in an effort to change the subject, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow is\\r\\nDick Thornton? I have been meaning to ask you what you have heard from\\r\\nhim.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time the younger girl flushed, but so slightly that Eugenia did\\r\\nnot appear to notice it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have heard nothing at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she returned honestly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nsuppose Dick is better, as Mildred and Nona have both had letters and\\r\\nsay there was nothing important in them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly Barbara took Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have more experience than the rest of us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she began with unusual\\r\\nhumility. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wonder if you think Dick has a chance of ever using his\\r\\narm again?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other girl hesitated. Certainly she had no right to believe that\\r\\nBarbara felt more than the natural interest in Dick that they all\\r\\nhad for Mildred\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brother and their own friend. And, as Barbara had\\r\\njust suggested, Eugenia was not supposed even to think on romantic\\r\\nsubjects. Nevertheless, her voice was unusually gentle as she replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really know one thing in the world about it, Barbara, but Dick\\r\\nis young and has lots of determination and most certainly I have not\\r\\ngiven up hope.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia had another twinge of pain in her temples at this second and so\\r\\nclosed her eyes. Although hearing a knock at their back door, she did\\r\\nnot open them even when Barbara left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nA moment later, hearing a strange sound, she was surprised by a sudden\\r\\nsense of terror, almost of suffocation. Yet surely she must be in a\\r\\nkind of nightmare brought on by her illness, since the sound suggested\\r\\nthe footsteps which had pursued her the night before and brought on the\\r\\nsame unreasoning fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nClutching the sides of her chair, Eugenia stared ahead of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere in the doorway, leading from the kitchen into the principal room\\r\\nof the farmhouse, stood an immense dog. It was odd the manner in which\\r\\nhe surveyed Eugenia. There was suspicion, distrust and withal an air\\r\\nof apology in his manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dog was a magnificent creature, a great Dane, silver-gray in\\r\\ncolor with a heavy silver collar about its throat, engraved with what\\r\\nappeared to be a coat of arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrdinarily Eugenia had a strong affection for animals, so it was absurd\\r\\nof her to be so nervous because of her experience the evening before.\\r\\nNevertheless, she felt again that she could neither speak nor move.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet at this moment Barbara danced in, pushing aside the big dog as\\r\\nfearlessly and unceremoniously as if he had been a Persian kitten. She\\r\\nheld a number of letters in her hands and a big bunch of autumn leaves.\\r\\nBehind her, with the eternal basket on his arm, hobbled old Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois,\\r\\nthe French servant from the home of the owner of their farmhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked like a little old brown gnome with his crooked legs, his\\r\\nstooping shoulders and brown peaked cap almost the color of his skin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFran\\xc3\\xa7ois is better than a fairy godmother--he is a fairy godfather!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nBarbara exclaimed delightedly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe has brought us letters and good news\\r\\nof all kinds this morning. You are sure to feel better when you hear,\\r\\nEugenia. But how did you happen to bring Duke over with you, Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois?\\r\\nI thought he was supposed to stay at home and take care of his mistress\\r\\nwhen you were compelled to leave her alone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia listened with only mild attention. Evidently this dog belonged\\r\\nto the countess upon whose estate they were living. He could scarcely\\r\\nbe the creature that had behaved so unceremoniously with her the night\\r\\nbefore.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois\\xe2\\x80\\x99 little black eyes were twinkling. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMonsieur le Duc is\\r\\nable to be with me because Madame is _not_ alone today,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained\\r\\nproudly.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia frowned. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a pompous, ridiculous name to bestow upon a dog,\\r\\nno matter how splendid he happened to be! But wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t there something\\r\\nfamiliar in his title? Surely it was the same name that the young\\r\\nFrench officer had used to his dog the night before!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X _Chateau d\\xe2\\x80\\x99Am\\xc3\\xa9lie_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Eugenia, you might as well confess that you are desperately\\r\\ninterested. If you say anything else we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbara\\r\\ndeclared positively.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree days afterward, between four and five in the afternoon, the four\\r\\nAmerican Red Cross girls were leaving the little French farmhouse\\r\\ntogether, and evidently with some definite intention. Nevertheless,\\r\\nthe journey could have nothing to do with their nursing, since the\\r\\nfaces and the costumes of three of the girls suggested a gala occasion.\\r\\nEugenia, however, having entirely recovered her health and poise, had\\r\\nreturned to her former manner and character. Yet she too was wearing\\r\\nher best dress, recently purchased in Paris, and was looking sternly\\r\\nhandsome.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen I might as well not answer you at all, Barbara, since you have\\r\\nmade up your mind already what I should reply,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she answered curtly.\\r\\nWithout intending to be ungracious she stalked off in front of the\\r\\nlittle procession.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other two girls laughed, but Barbara, making a little grimace, ran\\r\\non until she was able to catch up with Eugenia. She was beginning to\\r\\nthink now and then that the older girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s manner was more severe than\\r\\nher emotions. Now she gave her arm a little shake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be so superior, Miss Peabody from Boston! You must make\\r\\nyour confession along with the rest of us. So tell me the honest\\r\\ntruth--\\xe2\\x80\\x98hope I may-die-if-I-don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\xe2\\x80\\x99 kind--aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you terribly pleased\\r\\nthat the Countess, whose guests we have been for some time, has\\r\\ncondescended to be willing to meet us and has asked us to have coffee\\r\\nwith her this afternoon at her chateau?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nStill Eugenia demurred. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, I presume it will be a novel experience.\\r\\nNevertheless, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think we show proper pride in accepting an\\r\\ninvitation before the Countess has called upon us. It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the way we\\r\\ndo such things at home. If it comes to a question of family, of course\\r\\nI am an American, but the Peabodys of Boston----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s laughter rang out deliciously. She was in the gayest\\r\\npossible humor and suggested a little woodland creature in her brown\\r\\ncloth suit and hat with a single scarlet wing. What had become of the\\r\\nserious-minded young American woman devoting her life to the care of\\r\\nthe wounded?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a question of family, Eugenia, or how should I dare live\\r\\nand breathe in the same world with you, any more than with a French\\r\\ncountess?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she protested. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut please remember that we have accepted\\r\\na great deal more from this same Countess than a simple invitation to\\r\\nspend an hour with her. We are living in _her_ house, we have been\\r\\neating a goodly portion of her food. Oh, I know this is because we\\r\\nare in France to nurse the soldiers she adores! Still, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see\\r\\nthat this cancels our obligations. Besides, she is a much older woman\\r\\nand----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia put her one disengaged hand up to her ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI surrender, Barbara, in all meekness! But really, it is not necessary\\r\\nto produce so many arguments for doing a thing you are simply crazy\\r\\nto do. You merely wish to gratify your curiosity. You know, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nbelieve that we should be engaging in frivolous pursuits like paying\\r\\nvisits upon strangers, when we are here in Europe for such serious\\r\\npurposes. Still, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suppose that an occasional break really\\r\\ninterferes with our work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly not,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbara finished with emphasis. Then she skipped along\\r\\nbeside her taller companion like a small girl endeavoring to keep up\\r\\nwith a large one. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBesides, Eugenia, think of how wonderful the news\\r\\nis! The Germans are actually retiring of their own accord! There hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nbeen any fighting in our neighborhood for over a week now. No wonder\\r\\nthe Countess Am\\xc3\\xa9lie feels like having guests at last. Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois says\\r\\nthat she has not been so cheerful since the war began. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know\\r\\nhow you feel, Eugenia, but Mildred and Nona and I think it a wonderful\\r\\nexperience to see the inside of an old French home which was in\\r\\nexistence long before the French Revolutionary days. It seems that this\\r\\nCountess has never even gone to Paris, nor visited anyone except her\\r\\nold family friends who are also members of the nobility. She won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even\\r\\nacknowledge that France is today a great Republic. She still tries to\\r\\nlive like the _grande dames_ of the days before the Revolution.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia fairly sniffed. Also she held her shoulders straighter and her\\r\\nhead higher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen she must be a very absurd old woman and I am more than ever sure\\r\\nthat I shall not like her. The idea of not realizing that a republic is\\r\\nthe only just form of government in the world! I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be anything\\r\\nexcept an American----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more Barbara smiled, patting the older girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arm soothingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, my dear, and neither would any of the rest of\\r\\nus, except perhaps Nona. She is really an old-time aristocrat, although\\r\\nshe would rather perish than think so. But just the same I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see\\r\\nwhy one should not be interested in contrasts in this life! What could\\r\\nbe greater than the gulf between this old French aristocrat and us?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat indeed?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d answered Eugenia, more wisely than she then knew.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor at this moment the interest which the four girls had been feeling\\r\\nin their new hostess temporarily died away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Nona\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Barbara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suggestion, and in spite of the\\r\\ndistance, they were approaching the chateau through the woods, which\\r\\nthe two girls had visited the day after their arrival in this portion\\r\\nof southern France.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember had come, but the autumn was so far deliciously warm.\\r\\nDifficult it was to imagine a world at war on this afternoon and in\\r\\nthis particular forest! For, by some freak of fortune, this woodland\\r\\nhad so far escaped the ravages of the German shells. Over it and around\\r\\nit they had ploughed their devastating way. But until now the birds\\r\\nprepared their winter nests here undisturbed in the tall trees, and the\\r\\npool of Melisande remained unbroken save by its own ripples.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the girls walked more quietly along the path under the trees than\\r\\nin the open country. They were thinking perhaps of different things,\\r\\nwhile their eyes were absorbed in the loveliness about them. For after\\r\\nmonths of nursing, sometimes amid horrors and suffering one could not\\r\\nafterwards discuss, it was healing to both soul and body to inhale the\\r\\nsweetness of the earth and air.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouthern France was unlike the land lying to the north and close to the\\r\\nBelgian frontier, where the Red Cross girls had for some months past\\r\\nbeen nursing the British soldiers. That was an orchard and a vineyard\\r\\ncountry, this a land of forest and of golden grain fields. Many of the\\r\\ntrees were pine and cedar, yet there were occasional maples and elms,\\r\\nand here and there a chestnut.\\r\\n\\r\\nA small branch of scarlet and yellow leaves dropped near Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nfeet. It was a far call to her New England home, yet somehow the color\\r\\nand the atmosphere of the woods awakened home memories. Unconsciously\\r\\nEugenia stopped and thrust the bunch of leaves inside her belt.\\r\\nAgainst the blue of her costume they shone like flame, making her eyes\\r\\nand hair show darker by contrast and bringing a brighter tone to her\\r\\nclear but pale skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nNoticing the attractive effect of the careless decoration, the three\\r\\nother girls were far too wise to mention the fact to Eugenia, or\\r\\nassuredly the leaves would again have been trampled under foot.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, they had other interests more engrossing to absorb them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara and Nona led a short detour for a sight of the old hut that\\r\\nhad interested them on their previous walk. But Mildred and Eugenia\\r\\nwere both a little scornful of the story that this was a hermit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhut, uninhabited for a number of years. This afternoon it was so\\r\\nself-evident that some one was now living in it that Eugenia hurried\\r\\nthe others away. No one could be seen at the moment, but there was a\\r\\npile of fresh ashes in front of the house, a stack of freshly gathered\\r\\nwood and chips by the tumbled-down door, and a scarlet cap caught in\\r\\nthe top of a tall bush.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, because it was growing late and their invitation was for\\r\\nfive o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock, Eugenia could not be persuaded to linger by the tiny\\r\\nlake which Nona had christened by the poetic title of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPool of\\r\\nMelisande.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The pool one might visit on another afternoon, but perhaps\\r\\nthere might never come a like opportunity from the Countess.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, as the four girls finally approached the ancient stone\\r\\nhouse never would they have confessed to one another how nervous\\r\\nthey were feeling over the next hour. Nona Davis was perhaps least\\r\\nself-conscious. Life in the southern part of the United States among\\r\\na few conservative old families is not unlike that of the almost\\r\\nforgotten nobility of old France.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe path to the Chateau d\\xe2\\x80\\x99Am\\xc3\\xa9lie, whose title came down from the first\\r\\ncountess of the name, was as overgrown with weeds as any deserted\\r\\nfarmhouse. Yet who would look down at their feet when trees more than a\\r\\nhundred years old stood guard along the avenue leading to the ancient\\r\\nportico? And in crossing a rickety bridge could one think of the loose\\r\\nplanks, knowing that the muddy water that flowed under it was once the\\r\\nmoat that surrounded the feudal palace?\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, Barbara had to stifle a laugh when at length Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois\\r\\nopened the iron-bound wooden door admitting them to the chateau. For\\r\\ninstead of his peasant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blouse and peaked cap, this afternoon Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois\\r\\nwore a livery which must have been handed down to him by a majordomo\\r\\nat least twice his size. His small, bent-over form was almost lost in\\r\\nthe large trousers, while the tails of the long coat with its tarnished\\r\\ngold lace hung down past his knees.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois\\xe2\\x80\\x99 manner was equally changed. Gone was the friendly\\r\\nlight in his little dark eyes, the protecting, almost patronizing\\r\\nmanner which he had grown accustomed to using in his devoted service\\r\\nto the American Red Cross girls. This old Frenchman had his nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ngift of feeling the part he was called upon by fate to play. Today old\\r\\nFran\\xc3\\xa7ois felt himself a servant of the days of the great Louis XIV.\\r\\nApparently he had never seen his lady\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guests before.\\r\\n\\r\\nHobbling along, Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois conducted the visitors toward the drawing\\r\\nroom through a cold, gray stone hall. There was no furniture to be\\r\\nseen except two tall, carved chairs and an enormous shield, hanging\\r\\nsuspended from the wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nInside the drawing room, however, there was a kind of shabby splendor,\\r\\nvery interesting to the four American girls, no one of whom had seen\\r\\nanything like it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the floor was a great rug of tapestry showing nymphs and dolphins\\r\\ncarrying wreaths of fruit and flowers woven into the design. The blue\\r\\nand rose and brown of the colors had so faded that they were lovelier\\r\\nthan any artist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s palette could have painted them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four girls sat down in chairs covered with tapestry of the same\\r\\nkind, which they guessed must be almost priceless in value. But there\\r\\nwere only a few other articles of furniture in the room--a beautiful\\r\\nold cabinet, a mahogany table inlaid with brass, a Louis XIV sofa,\\r\\nwhile on the walls were not more than half a dozen pictures by French\\r\\nmasters. Nevertheless, the room was complete in beauty and elegance.\\r\\nSo the American girls did not dream that once it had been crowded with\\r\\nrare treasures, sold one by one to meet the family necessities.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there were only a few minutes in which the guests could make\\r\\na study of their surroundings. Very soon their hostess entered with\\r\\nold Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois bowing before her as if she had been an empress. She was\\r\\naccompanied by a young man in the uniform of a French officer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Countess Am\\xc3\\xa9lie wore a dress of black silk and on her head a cap of\\r\\nlace with the Marie Antoinette point in front. Her hair was exquisitely\\r\\nwhite and her eyes dark. In spite of the natural coldness and hauteur\\r\\nof her expression she was evidently trying to appear friendly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer four guests bowed gravely as she shook hands with them, welcoming\\r\\nthem to her home. However, it must be confessed that Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bow was\\r\\neven more stiff than her hostess\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso Eugenia frowned, while the other three girls smiled. For the young\\r\\nofficer, whom the Countess Am\\xc3\\xa9lie afterwards introduced as her son, was\\r\\nCaptain Henri Castaigne, whom they had met through Lieutenant Hume in\\r\\nParis, and upon whom they had seen bestowed the Cross of the Legion of\\r\\nHonor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI _The Prejudice Deepens_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen you knew we were here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nona questioned half shyly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNona and Barbara were seated on a wide window seat with Captain\\r\\nCastaigne beside them. A little further on Eugenia, in a carved,\\r\\nhigh-back chair, was watching the group but taking little part in the\\r\\nconversation. Mildred and the Countess Am\\xc3\\xa9lie were on the opposite side\\r\\nof the great room, still having their coffee and chatting amiably,\\r\\nthough in not an animated fashion. For the Countess would have scorned\\r\\nto speak any language but her beloved French, and while Mildred\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nFrench was good it was not very rapid. Nevertheless, her manners were\\r\\nundeniably sweet and unaffected and the Countess plainly approved of\\r\\nher more than any one of the other girls.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Castaigne smiled at Nona.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I had my suspicions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he answered, with the faintest gleam\\r\\nof amusement in his dark eyes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMoreover, I received a letter from\\r\\nLieutenant Hume telling me that four American Red Cross girls had\\r\\ndisappeared from Paris and were nursing somewhere in southern France.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThe young officer bowed his head with a pretense of penitence. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlso\\r\\nI must confess that I have asked a few questions of old Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois. You\\r\\nsee, I have only recently been transferred to a regiment near my own\\r\\nhome, else I should have prayed for the privilege of calling upon you.\\r\\nBut not having seen any one of you until this afternoon, I could not be\\r\\nsure my surmise was correct.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her throne-like chair Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shoulders assumed a straighter pose,\\r\\nwhile her face turned unexpectedly scarlet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you entirely convinced you have seen _no one_ of us since our\\r\\nmeeting in Paris?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she inquired so suddenly and in such a peculiar\\r\\ntone, even for Eugenia, that Nona and Barbara turned to glance toward\\r\\nher in surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot having spoken in the past ten minutes, her eyes were now fixed upon\\r\\nthe young French officer with an expression which Barbara Meade at\\r\\nleast recognized. It plainly expressed disapproval.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, there was no reason why Captain Castaigne should\\r\\ninstantly become embarrassed. Up to this time he had been a delightful\\r\\nhost, gracious and gay. Certainly his manners were not like those\\r\\nof an American or an Englishman, but Nona and Barbara instinctively\\r\\nunderstood that his fashion of paying pretty compliments and his\\r\\nsomewhat devoted air as he talked to one, were simply characteristics\\r\\nof a foreigner.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, however, he blushed and stammered like a school-boy. With\\r\\nEugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gaze upon him he crimsoned and cast down his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I _have_ seen one of you before I am sure I have not recognized\\r\\nyou,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he returned with unnecessary humility. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have been at work with\\r\\nmy soldiers most of the time since receiving my new command. I only\\r\\nreturn to the chateau occasionally to see my mother.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nostrils arched slightly in a way she had when angry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you usually pay these visits in the daytime or in the evening?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nquestioned, with what seemed to the other two girls rather too much\\r\\ncuriosity. For these were war times when one was not supposed to ask\\r\\nquestions that were not absolutely necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill the young officer showed no resentment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have no regular hour, Mademoiselle. Whenever I can be spared I\\r\\ndesire to be with my mother. There are only the two of us and we have\\r\\nbeen much separated. First there were the years devoted to my training\\r\\nas a soldier and since has come the cruel fortune of war.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the opposite side of the room the Countess Am\\xc3\\xa9lie must at this\\r\\nmoment have guessed that her son was speaking of her. She looked toward\\r\\nhim with such a combination of pride and devotion that it was almost\\r\\ntouching. Her whole face softened.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Eugenia did not observe her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not so sure we have not met each other in this neighborhood quite\\r\\nrecently,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she continued with extraordinary coldness. Nona and Barbara\\r\\nbecame more and more surprised. For although Eugenia was not cordial\\r\\nwith strangers, she was usually civil. Vainly they were searching\\r\\ntheir minds for some remark with which to turn the current of the\\r\\nconversation when Eugenia went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was on my way home to our little farmhouse the other evening, after\\r\\nnursing at the field hospital until quite late. I met some one, an\\r\\nofficer, I think. It was then too dark for me to see his face, but I\\r\\nhave been wondering ever since----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech was interrupted, but not by one of her\\r\\ncompanions. For the heavy door of the drawing room was pushed slowly\\r\\nopen and a great dog walked majestically into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused for an instant to gaze at his mistress. Then receiving her\\r\\nsilent permission, he started a pilgrimage about the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nNona shrank behind the smaller Barbara, for in spite of her usual\\r\\nbravery she had a nervous fear of dogs. However, this great Dane was\\r\\nnot to be feared by guests inside his own domain. As he padded from\\r\\none visitor to the other it was plain that he was greeting each one of\\r\\nthem in turn. Mildred came first and was allowed to lay her hand on his\\r\\nhead, then Nona and Barbara. Afterwards the dog moved toward Eugenia.\\r\\nWithin a few feet of her he paused, his ears and tail visibly drooping,\\r\\nand turned imploring eyes upon his young master.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever the signal that passed between them, the next moment the\\r\\nsplendid creature sank down at Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feet, burying his head between\\r\\nhis forepaws. His whole attitude indicated a prayer for pardon.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately after Captain Castaigne got up and walked over toward\\r\\nEugenia. He stood silent for half a moment, evidently hoping that she\\r\\nmight relax from her severity.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever in his life had he met such an extraordinary and difficult young\\r\\nwoman! As he had been under the same impression five minutes after\\r\\ntheir introduction in Paris, why should Fate be so unkind as to cause\\r\\nthem to see each other again? And then to place him in such an awkward\\r\\nposition as he now found himself!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI owe you ten thousand pardons, Mademoiselle. Ah, more than that, for\\r\\nI consider my own act unpardonable!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUntil you spoke I\\r\\nhad been hoping that I might be mistaken, and that it was _not_ you\\r\\nwhom I caused to suffer the other evening.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young Frenchman cast his eyes imploringly toward Eugenia, clasping\\r\\nhis hands together in a dramatic fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf only Eugenia had been able to smile at this moment, how much simpler\\r\\nthe future would have been! But remember, Eugenia had a Puritan\\r\\nconscience, and a Puritan conscience often exacts its pound of flesh in\\r\\npayment for sins from other people as well as from itself. Moreover,\\r\\nEugenia disliked Captain Castaigne\\xe2\\x80\\x99s manners and appearance intensely.\\r\\nTo her he appeared theatrical and insincere. A simple, straightforward\\r\\nAmerican apology she believed she would have accepted at once. But this\\r\\nyoung aristocrat with his too perfect features and physique must suffer\\r\\nfor his offense. No doubt the other girls would have forgiven him.\\r\\nHe looked like the type of man most women would deal gently with, so\\r\\nEugenia felt it would undoubtedly be good for him to be snubbed by her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she now stared severely at the young Frenchman in answer to his\\r\\npleading, she looked like all the Pilgrim fathers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 portraits that hang\\r\\non old New England family walls melted together into one face. Of\\r\\ncourse, he did not understand her in the least. Lieutenant Hume had\\r\\nexplained that the Miss Peabody he had met in Paris was an old maid\\r\\nfrom Boston. But this conveyed nothing to Captain Castaigne\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind. Old\\r\\nmaids in France were not in the least like this young woman and he had\\r\\na very vague idea of where Boston was and of what the city could be\\r\\nlike. However, he did know that he had offended against a Frenchman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nand an officer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s code of manners and was therefore willing to make any\\r\\npossible apology.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou will understand that not only did I not know you: I did not\\r\\nrealize that you were a woman or I should never have sent my dog to\\r\\ninterrupt you. Why, why did you not halt when I called out to you? If\\r\\nonly you had given one little sign, made the least sound! I thought I\\r\\nshould have fainted when I beheld a figure upon the ground and in the\\r\\nuniform of a Red Cross nurse, the uniform I respect most in all the\\r\\nworld.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere could be no doubt of Captain Castaigne\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sincerity at this\\r\\nmoment. Nona and Barbara, who were listening with intense interest to\\r\\nhis plea, were deeply moved by the tribute he thus paid the Red Cross\\r\\nwork. But if Eugenia felt this she did not reveal it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI prefer not to discuss the accident,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she returned, rising from her\\r\\nchair and preparing to leave. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly I realize that you would not\\r\\nhave desired to injure me personally had you known I was a Red Cross\\r\\nnurse. But I cannot see that you are justified in sending that great\\r\\nbeast of a dog to attack wayfarers, simply because you do not chance to\\r\\nknow who they are.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara and Nona had also gotten up intending to withdraw with their\\r\\nfriend. Actually at this moment Barbara had the temerity to giggle,\\r\\nalthough no one but Nona was aware of it. It was so absurd to hear\\r\\nEugenia lecturing a French officer with regard to his duties and\\r\\nprivileges. It was even funnier to see the spirit in which he accepted\\r\\nhis snubbing!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, Mademoiselle,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued, shrugging his slender shoulders,\\r\\ndecorated with the gold braid of his rank, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csurely you must appreciate\\r\\nthat in these war times we have many dangerous visitors to our\\r\\nentrenchments. One cannot permit a wanderer to remain at large who\\r\\nrefuses to give an account of himself? Besides, my dog would have\\r\\ninjured no one. He had his orders merely to hold the prisoner until I\\r\\ncould reach him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Castaigne laid his boyish hand on the head of the great\\r\\ndog, who at once rose up clumsily and stood beside him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome day,\\r\\nMademoiselle, I shall pray that my dog and I may do you a service to\\r\\natone for our mistake. To many a wounded soldier Le Duc has brought\\r\\naid on the battlefield. In any case the offense was mine, while his\\r\\nonly that of obedience to a stupid master. Say at least that you\\r\\nforgive my dog?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young officer spoke so winningly that even Eugenia was compelled to\\r\\nrelent slightly. However, she still retained an uncomfortable vision\\r\\nof herself, face downward upon the ground with this young Captain\\r\\nCastaigne holding the light above her and gazing down on her prostrate\\r\\nform.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, she accepted the large paw that Duke stretched forth\\r\\nto her. As the eyes of Eugenia and the dog met, the ghost of an\\r\\nunderstanding passed between them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next instant, after saying farewell to their hostess, she departed,\\r\\nthe other three Red Cross girls following her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a very objectionable young woman,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Countess Am\\xc3\\xa9lie remarked\\r\\nto her son in French, when speaking of their guests a short time\\r\\nafterwards. The young officer did not inquire which one of the four\\r\\ngirls she meant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII _Not Peace But War_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLater that same evening the girls were seated in their living room at\\r\\nthe farmhouse. It was almost bed time, so heavy curtains had been drawn\\r\\nacross their small windows, shutting out all possible vision of the\\r\\noutside world.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut wearing their four new kimonos the girls were grouped in\\r\\ncharacteristic attitudes about a small fireplace on the right side of\\r\\nthe room.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, after a warm afternoon, a November rain had fallen, bringing\\r\\nwith it cold and dampness. So, although a fire in France is regarded\\r\\nas a great luxury, the American girls felt compelled to have one. It\\r\\nwas not of the generous kind to which they were accustomed at home, but\\r\\nwas built of carefully hoarded sticks and pine cones old Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois had\\r\\nbrought them from time to time as valuable gifts. Therefore, the girls\\r\\nwere huddled closer to the fire and to one another than under ordinary\\r\\ncircumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust at present, however, there was no talking going on, which was\\r\\nmost unusual, since Nona and Barbara were especially addicted to this\\r\\nfeminine habit, while neither Eugenia nor Mildred were extraordinarily\\r\\nsilent. However, at the moment both Mildred and Nona were writing\\r\\nletters, while Barbara was reading a queer, old-fashioned book she had\\r\\ndiscovered stored away in the attic of their little farmhouse. It was,\\r\\nof course, written in French, and she was supposed to be improving her\\r\\nvocabulary. But the French was so peculiar that now and then she was\\r\\nforced to stop to consult a dictionary.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia was also reading, although her literature was of a more serious\\r\\ncharacter. She was studying a series of reports the Red Cross societies\\r\\nof Europe had recently issued. The papers offered important information\\r\\nand advice to the Red Cross nurses, and Eugenia was too deeply\\r\\ninterested in her profession to neglect any chance for improvement.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe and Mildred were at a small table by the fire with the lamp between\\r\\nthem, while Nona and Barbara were mounted upon sofa cushions, which\\r\\nthey had placed on the bare floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by Barbara glanced up at the alarm clock on the mantelpiece.\\r\\nIt was standing side by side with a tall French clock of silver gilt\\r\\nthat must once have been a bridal offering. However, the French clock\\r\\nhad these long years been silent, while tonight the plebeian American\\r\\ntimepiece ticked resolutely on.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeing the hour, Barbara yawned, closed her book and then, clasping her\\r\\nhands over her knees, began rocking slowly back and forth.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one at first paid the least attention to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is nearly bed time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she announced finally, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I do wish\\r\\neverybody would stop what they are doing and let us talk for a while.\\r\\nSomehow tonight I feel as if we were four girls away at a foreign\\r\\nboarding school, instead of four young women intent upon caring for the\\r\\nwounded. How wonderful if by chance we were nearing the end of this\\r\\nimpossible war!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this there was another instant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s silence, though each girl was\\r\\nkeenly aware of Barbara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s last speech. Nona looked up toward the little\\r\\nwooden crucifix, belonging to the owners of the farmhouse, which had\\r\\nbeen left in its honored place upon the wall. Her lips said nothing,\\r\\nbut the appeal of her spirit went deeper than words. Mildred\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes\\r\\nsuddenly blurred with tears. She had been writing to her father,\\r\\nwhom she adored, and all at once the time seemed endless since their\\r\\nfarewell. But Eugenia merely put down her papers and sat watching the\\r\\nyounger girl on the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nExcept for the fall of the rain the night was very still. There was no\\r\\nthunder and lightning and no wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps it was because of what she had just been reading, or the\\r\\ndiscomfort of her visit earlier in the afternoon, but Eugenia was\\r\\nfeeling curiously unstrung. Somehow Barbara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s innocent remark disturbed\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think there is any chance of the war\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being over for many a\\r\\nlong day, Barbara,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she returned curtly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust because we have been\\r\\nhaving a lull in the fighting lately you must not feel that work is\\r\\nover. That is, not unless you want to go home. I often think that best\\r\\nfor all of you three young girls. If you can feel like a boarding\\r\\nschool miss, Bab, certainly you are an infant. But it is good of you to\\r\\ninclude me among the pupils in view of what you really think about my\\r\\nage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara laughed, although a little surprised and touched by a portion\\r\\nof the other girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech. For had not Eugenia called her Bab and laid\\r\\nher strong, fine hand on her hair? Barbara rather liked the feeling\\r\\nof Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fingers. They were firm and yet gentle tonight. Always\\r\\nBarbara knew that they were singularly handsome hands, and more than\\r\\nthat, they were hands revealing unusual ability. They were not small,\\r\\nbut slender and long, with beautiful almond-shaped nails and a curious,\\r\\nvibrant quality at the finger tips.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara took one of them in her own and studied it curiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have wonderful nursing hands, Eugenia. One feels as if they could\\r\\ntake away pain and almost bring people back to life. Of course, I know\\r\\nyou are right about the war. It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t over just because of the heavenly\\r\\nquiet we have been having lately in this neighborhood. But do let us be\\r\\nfrivolous while we can. Mildred, you have finished your letter, haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nyou? Nona, when will you ever be through? To whom on earth are you\\r\\nwriting that you can have so much to say? Whoever he or she is I wish\\r\\ncould see you. You look like a Fra Angelico angel in that flowing blue\\r\\nrobe tonight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJust long enough to blow a kiss Nona looked up. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, I am writing\\r\\nto Dick Thornton,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she explained casually. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had a letter from him\\r\\nthe other day asking me to tell him just what we were doing. He said\\r\\nMildred would never tell him half enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA strange little lump mysteriously caught in Barbara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s throat. Dick had\\r\\nnot yet written her and she had thought they were as intimate friends\\r\\nas he and Nona. Then the smile that was characteristic of her ability\\r\\nto see things truthfully hovered around her lips. After all, did she\\r\\nreally desire Dick Thornton to behold Nona tonight? Never had she seen\\r\\nher looking prettier! She had on a blue cr\\xc3\\xaape wrapper the color of the\\r\\nItalian sky, her pale yellow hair was unbound and hanging in a single\\r\\nlong curl down her back. Moreover, the fire had flushed her cheeks and\\r\\nmade her dark eyes shine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen noticing that Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes were studying her gravely, Barbara\\r\\nshook her head and laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have a perfectly delicious piece of gossip to confide, if you will\\r\\nall listen. If you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to bed this minute.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNona sealed her letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat on earth are you talking about, Barbara?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she demanded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow can\\r\\nyou have heard any more gossip than the rest of us? You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have\\r\\nfound a lost will or a lost romance in that old book you dug out of the\\r\\nattic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving at last gained the desired attention of her audience, the\\r\\nyoungest of the four Red Cross girls was not disposed to hurry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, no, not exactly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she hedged. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd yet I have been amusing\\r\\nmyself fitting the two stories together. Remember the young girl we saw\\r\\ndancing for the soldiers the other afternoon?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGoodness, yes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Eugenia replied. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut what a surprising person you\\r\\nare, Barbara. She is about the last person in the world I would have\\r\\nguessed you had in mind. What on earth made you think of her again?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHolding up three fingers, Barbara counted them out slowly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne, two,\\r\\nthree things made me think of her. Now listen to me attentively, for\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98hereby hangs a tale.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And perhaps if we exercise enough imagination we\\r\\ncan turn it into the oldest romance of the Troubadours, those poets of\\r\\nold Provence whose names stand high in the records of song and story.\\r\\nRemember the tale of \\xe2\\x80\\x98Aucassin and Nicolete\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is over seven hundred\\r\\nyears old! We may have to make a few changes to fit it into modern\\r\\ntimes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMildred Thornton made no effort to stifle her yawn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, goodness gracious, do go on and get to your story or I shall\\r\\nretire to bed. At least I remember that the blond young soldier told\\r\\nyou the little dancing girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name was Nicolete. It was odd for you to\\r\\ncome across the poem so unexpectedly tonight. I read it long ago in my\\r\\nliterature class at school. But where, please, is \\xe2\\x80\\x98Aucassin,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the hero\\r\\nof your tale, and where, for that matter, is Nicolete? You told me that\\r\\nshe was supposed to disappear after her dance and no one knew what had\\r\\nbecome of her,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mildred protested.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara turned appealingly to Eugenia. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo make Mildred hush and not\\r\\ntake the fine flavor from my romance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she begged. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe young soldier\\r\\nmay not have known where the young dancing girl lives, but I do.\\r\\nIndeed, we all passed her home this afternoon. Didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you see a little\\r\\nscarlet cap on the bayberry bush outside the old hut in the woods?\\r\\nWell, Nicolete has been living there recently, with an old grandmother,\\r\\nor an old woman of some kind. She is the adopted daughter of some\\r\\nmysterious person, I am told. You recall that Nicolete was a slave\\r\\ngirl owned by a viscount?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia got up slowly out of her chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean to be rude, child, but really I have to attend to some\\r\\nthings before I go to bed and your story seems rather far fetched. Tell\\r\\nus who Nicolete\\xe2\\x80\\x99s adoring lover is and wait until tomorrow for the\\r\\nrest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara shrugged her shoulders petulantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf all the disagreeable audiences this is the worst!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asserted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nthought maybe you might be interested in something except horrors. The\\r\\nstory is that this little gypsy girl is really very much in love with\\r\\nCaptain Castaigne, whom we saw this afternoon. That is, she may not be\\r\\nexactly in love with him, but the soldiers think she is. His mother is\\r\\nterribly angry, because, of course, they belong to one of the oldest\\r\\nfamilies in France while she is \\xe2\\x80\\x98Poor Little Miss Nobody of Nowhere.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nThen another romantic point is that the little blond soldier who gave\\r\\nus the flowers is enamored of Nicolete. Monsieur Beb\\xc3\\xa9 is what the\\r\\nother soldiers call him, so I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t so far wrong in thinking he looked\\r\\nlike a baby.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara did not observe that Eugenia was frowning majestically and that\\r\\nMildred Thornton looked rather bored.\\r\\n\\r\\nNona, however, was smiling good-humoredly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHurry up and finish, Barbara. Is Captain Castaigne pining away for the\\r\\nfair Nicolete, refusing to be a knight or to bear arms for his country?\\r\\nI thought he was supposed to be an extraordinary young officer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nona\\r\\nquestioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nUndoubtedly Barbara was crestfallen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose that is the weakest part of the story,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she confessed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know whether Captain Castaigne cares for this particular Nicolete\\r\\nin the least. He does not care for anything but his beloved country, I\\r\\nbelieve. But if you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be interested in my romance, please listen to\\r\\nthe first part of my poem,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbara begged, picking up her discarded\\r\\nbook. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is a translation here of the first verse:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho would list in right good verse\\r\\n   Tale of grief full sad to hear,\\r\\n   Of two children young and fair,\\r\\n   Nicolete and Aucassin;\\r\\n   Of the woes he had to bear\\r\\n   And the doughty deeds to dare\\r\\n   For his love with face so clear?\\r\\n   Sweet the song, the fable rare,\\r\\n   Courtly and well served the fare;\\r\\n   No man is so full of care,\\r\\n   None so wretched, none so bare,\\r\\n   So o\\xe2\\x80\\x99erdriven by despair\\r\\n   But the hearing will repair,\\r\\n   Give him jollity to spare,\\r\\n   So rich the tale.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she finished the verse Eugenia reached down and taking hold of\\r\\nBarbara lifted her to her feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are perfectly absurd with your little love tale, dear, and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nsee the least point in it. Still, it has been nice and restful to have\\r\\nhad a quiet evening like this. Perhaps it is better for us to forget\\r\\nthe tragedies about us now and then. Besides, I expect I need more\\r\\neducation in romance. But go upstairs to bed, all of you at once. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nclose up the house for the night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia shooed the three girls away as if they had been chickens and\\r\\nshe a guardian hen. But after they left her she did not start upon her\\r\\ntask at once. Instead she stood with her hands clasped looking down\\r\\ninto the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside the rain must have ceased for she no longer heard the noise of\\r\\nit. Indeed, the world seemed strangely quiet to ears accustomed to the\\r\\ncannonading she had heard so often in the past months.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she was not thinking of this at the present moment, but of her\\r\\nvisit to the chateau earlier in the afternoon. The call had not been\\r\\nan agreeable one, for she had never felt more ill at ease. However,\\r\\nEugenia made up her mind that she would never accept an invitation\\r\\nthere again. She might then escape meeting either the Countess or her\\r\\nson. And with this thought in mind she stopped to put out the last\\r\\nflickering flames of the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere she remained crouched in the same position for five minutes,\\r\\nwhile upstairs in their bedrooms the other three American Red Cross\\r\\ngirls were almost equally inanimate. For after the quiet of the night\\r\\ntheir ears and hearts were suddenly stunned by a burst of terrific\\r\\nartillery firing. It was as if all the heavy guns of all the armies in\\r\\nEurope were concentrated upon this particular quarter in France.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by Eugenia rose up wearily with her face whiter and older than\\r\\nit had been for some time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am afraid the Germans have not retreated of their own accord,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nsaid, unconsciously speaking aloud. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe may have some hard days ahead\\r\\nof us. But if they do manage to force the French line of trenches and\\r\\nreach us, I shall not care so much if only the other girls can get\\r\\naway. It will not so much matter with a woman as old as I am, and I\\r\\nshall be glad to be useful.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIII _Danger_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll night the bombardment continued. Now and then the girls slept, but\\r\\nmore often they lay awake, wondering just where the fighting could be\\r\\ntaking place and if the field hospital could be in danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at daylight the noise grew less and three of the girls fell into\\r\\ndeeper slumber than they had known since saying good-night to one\\r\\nanother.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Eugenia did not wish to sleep again. Very quietly she got up and\\r\\nwent about their little house hiding away their stores of provisions.\\r\\nThen she locked up odd windows and doors that might by chance be\\r\\nforgotten. Afterwards she investigated her own bag of nursing supplies\\r\\nand saw that everything that might be needed for emergency work was\\r\\nthere.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough it was still between five and six o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock, Eugenia next made\\r\\nthings ready for breakfast and then went upstairs and waked the other\\r\\ngirls. Well she knew that their services would be needed earlier than\\r\\nusual that morning! The night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fighting meant many more wounded, who\\r\\nwould be brought to them for succor as soon as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, once they were up and dressed, the girls naturally wished to\\r\\nbe off to their work at once. Yet against their wills Eugenia insisted\\r\\nthat they eat unusually large breakfasts. She even packed a basket of\\r\\nfood for them to take to the hospital, although their noonday meal was\\r\\nalways given them there.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, nothing was said at breakfast about her proceedings, but\\r\\nlater Barbara followed Eugenia about their little house, regarding her\\r\\nsuspiciously.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesultory firing was still going on; occasionally one could hear the\\r\\ncracking of a score of rifles or the shriek of a bursting shell. But\\r\\nthis had become a common experience in the past nine months to the\\r\\nAmerican Red Cross girls and would hardly explain Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unusually\\r\\nserious view of the situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally Barbara managed to corner the older girl in the kitchen, where\\r\\nshe laid her hand quietly on her arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTell me, Eugenia, please, have you any special reason for believing\\r\\nthat the fighting is to be more serious in this neighborhood than any\\r\\nwe have yet seen? Have the soldiers or officers told you to expect\\r\\nunusual trouble? Tell me the truth. I would rather know, and I think\\r\\nI can promise not to be such a coward as I was when our war nursing\\r\\nstarted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment Eugenia hesitated. Her face was serious but not severe\\r\\nthis morning and the two expressions were very unlike.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am going to tell you exactly the truth, Barbara, when I say that no\\r\\none has given me information of any kind. I have only heard, just as\\r\\nyou have, that after months of fighting in this locality the Germans\\r\\nevacuated their trenches and moved back of the line of their own\\r\\naccord. But the truth is, I have been feeling horribly uneasy ever\\r\\nsince I became aware of the impression this had made on the French army\\r\\nnear here. I have always feared it was a piece of clever strategy on\\r\\nthe part of the Germans to gain time and perhaps to bring up more guns.\\r\\nAnd all last night, while the cannonading was going on, after weeks\\r\\nof comparative quiet, I became more and more convinced of my idea. Of\\r\\ncourse, it may be absurd, but just the same I have the feeling that we\\r\\nought to be prepared for perhaps the most strenuous times of our lives.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly Eugenia placed her hands on either side Barbara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cheeks,\\r\\nwhich had grown round and rosy as a child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s again, with the weeks of\\r\\noutdoor life and the easier work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want you to promise me something, Barbara; promise for yourself\\r\\nand if you can to use your influence with the other girls. If by\\r\\nchance the enemy should conquer this part of France and our field\\r\\nhospital be forced to move further back, you will go back with them.\\r\\nBut if anything should happen to make this impossible, go to the\\r\\nCountess Am\\xc3\\xa9lie and remain with her. She is a stranger, but she is an\\r\\nolder woman and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d feel ever so much happier to have you under her\\r\\nprotection.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTrying her best to show no signs of uneasiness at Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech,\\r\\nnevertheless Barbara Meade\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face unconsciously whitened and her blue\\r\\neyes grew dark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is a rather impossible promise,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she returned, smiling, although\\r\\nher voice was not quite steady. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course, I am not convinced that\\r\\nyou are right in your fears in the first place, but if you should\\r\\nbe, why are you asking me to influence the other girls to leave this\\r\\nneighborhood? You have a great deal more influence that I have. Do you\\r\\nmean that you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t intend to go with us?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this the older girl walked across the room and stood for a moment\\r\\nby the one window which looked out upon the woods. If she had wished\\r\\nto reply at once it would have been impossible. For at this instant a\\r\\ntremendous shell exploded at no great distance away, shaking the little\\r\\nhouse and making a noise that was almost deafening.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet neither girl mentioned the occurrence to the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it was over Eugenia turned quietly around.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI expect to remain here if I find I can be more useful. But after all,\\r\\nI may be talking like a foolish old crow croaking over misfortunes that\\r\\nnever come. Goodness knows, the French have repelled numbers of attacks\\r\\nbefore! Even if the Germans have reinforcements they will probably\\r\\ndrive them back. I only wanted us to be prepared to meet the worst. But\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m dreadfully sorry if I have frightened you unnecessarily, so perhaps\\r\\nit will be best not to speak of my foolishness to the other girls. Now\\r\\nlet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hurry and be off.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Barbara would not be hurried, neither would she be silenced.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat down for a moment on the top of a high wooden stool, her feet\\r\\nswinging in the air, looking like a little girl of fourteen, in spite\\r\\nof the fact that she wore her nurse\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cap and uniform.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think you forget that we are Red Cross nurses,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbara argued\\r\\nthoughtfully, talking not so much to her companion as to herself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo\\r\\neven if the Germans do take the trenches in this vicinity and occupy\\r\\nthe French country, we shall be perfectly safe. Our Red Cross badges\\r\\nare our protection.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe older girl put her arm across the younger one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shoulder, not\\r\\naffectionately, but protectingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMore than probably you are right, Barbara. But somehow I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d feel\\r\\nhappier not to have you girls too near here. Many of the houses may\\r\\nbe burned and the German soldiers excited by their triumph. It would\\r\\nbe the same in any conquered country, I have no doubt. I do not mean\\r\\nthat I think the German soldiers more brutal than other men under like\\r\\nconditions. But remember, we have been living in an enemy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s country and\\r\\nnursing their soldiers and even if ninety-nine of the soldiers were\\r\\nconsiderate, one might be rough and unkind. Of course, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make you\\r\\npromise to do what I ask against your will, but if the danger comes\\r\\nwill you remember what I have said and try and be prudent?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Barbara nodded as she got off her stool.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say anything to the others, but I am going to put the Red\\r\\nCross flag on our little house before we leave,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she answered, speaking\\r\\nin the most matter-of-fact tone. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do any possible harm and\\r\\nI think might have been a good idea all along to advertise us to our\\r\\nneighbors. Dear little \\xe2\\x80\\x98House with the Blue Front Door,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I hope we may\\r\\nnot leave you in many months! Somehow I have grown deeply attached to\\r\\nyou!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA little while afterwards the four girls started for the field\\r\\nhospital, which was situated about a mile on this side of the last row\\r\\nof the French trenches.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough they had been up for some time, it was not more than half-past\\r\\nsix when they set out. The air was still and heavy with smoke. It would\\r\\nhave been difficult to decide whether the noise of the distant guns or\\r\\nthe ominous lull in the firing was more trying to the nerves.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the girls did not discuss the situation as they walked along.\\r\\nIndeed, they did not talk at all, but plodded quietly ahead, intent on\\r\\nthe work before them and saving all their strength until then.\\r\\n\\r\\nA short distance from the field hospital they were met by two of the\\r\\nhospital assistants. One of them joined Eugenia, the other kept in the\\r\\ngroup with the other three girls. They were two American college boys.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThings are pretty lively around here, Miss Peabody. I suppose you have\\r\\nbeen hearing the racket all night. The news is that the Germans have\\r\\ncaptured thirty yards of the first line of the French trenches, but of\\r\\ncourse we are expecting the Frenchies to get them back again. Still, it\\r\\nmight have been wiser if you had stayed in your own place today. Your\\r\\nhouse is a little farther back.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia smiled in a friendly fashion at her companion. She was\\r\\nsurprisingly popular with the staff at the field hospital, although\\r\\nordinarily having little to say to them except upon matters concerning\\r\\nher nursing. But the young fellow who had walked out to meet them was a\\r\\nHarvard University boy who had come to France to assist with the field\\r\\nhospital work. He was one of fourteen or fifteen young fellows who were\\r\\nable to take down or set up one of the new field hospitals, consisting\\r\\nof some twenty tents, in about half an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally as he and Eugenia hailed from the Bay State, there was that\\r\\nbond between them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave they been bringing in many wounded this morning?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Eugenia asked\\r\\nas quietly as if she had been discussing an ordinary topic.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer companion nodded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt has been pretty bad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he returned, trying to\\r\\nspeak with an affectation of carelessness. The fact is he had intended\\r\\nstudying to be a surgeon after graduating at college and of course\\r\\nshould not be upset by a few wounded men. But it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t very jolly to\\r\\nsee a lot of fellows suffering and not to be able to help them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen I expect we had best hurry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Eugenia answered. Afterwards neither\\r\\nof them spoke again. Yet the young man looked at Eugenia admiringly.\\r\\nPerhaps she was not as much of a beauty as two of the other American\\r\\nRed Cross girls. Nevertheless, she wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bad looking in her way, and\\r\\ncertainly a man would like to have her take care of him if he happened\\r\\nto be bowled over. You could always count on her being right there\\r\\nwhen the time came, and knowing exactly what to do. One couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help\\r\\nadmiring efficiency in this world wherever one saw it.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly the American boy had been right in his statement. Conditions\\r\\nat the field hospital were pretty bad when the four girls arrived there.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the beds in the tents were filled with the wounded. Yet every five\\r\\nor ten minutes another injured soldier requiring immediate care would\\r\\nbe borne to the hospital by his companions until long lines of them\\r\\nwere stretched out upon the grass. Moreover, one knew that there were\\r\\nperhaps hundreds of others lying hurt in the trenches to whom no relief\\r\\ncould be given until the fighting ceased.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow there seemed little prospect that a lull could come until the\\r\\nnight. Then perhaps the bombarding would not be so continuous.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the Germans must have previously located the weak points in\\r\\nthe enemy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s defences since the cannonading had begun the night before.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree or four hours passed and no one appeared to think there could be\\r\\ndanger at the field hospital. Perhaps they were too busy to think at\\r\\nall. Besides, the firing seemed to be directed upon the trenches, so\\r\\nthat only an occasional shell, failing to hit its mark, shrieked over\\r\\nthem or burst at a distance too far away to cause alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it must have been about noon, though no one knew the exact hour,\\r\\nwhen suddenly news came that the French had been forced to retreat\\r\\nfrom the front trenches to the second line. Then immediately after the\\r\\nGermans directed a number of their large guns, not upon the trenches,\\r\\nbut upon the little town of Le Pr\\xc3\\xaatre, which lay behind the field\\r\\nhospital, the forest and the chateau of the Countess Am\\xc3\\xa9lie.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor did the shells and shrapnel continue to pass over the hospital.\\r\\nIndeed, they sometimes seemed to be the actual target of the great\\r\\nguns, though this was of course not true.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the white tents was torn to pieces and a doctor and two nurses\\r\\nhurt.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara had just come out of this tent on an errand for the surgeon.\\r\\nAfter the explosion she found herself standing but a few yards from the\\r\\nd\\xc3\\xa9bris, with Nona Davis running toward her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe field hospital is to be moved, Barbara dear, and they wish all of\\r\\nus to go along with them. Eugenia and Mildred cannot leave, but you and\\r\\nI are to go back to our little house and pack up the things we actually\\r\\nmust have. Everything and everybody connected with the hospital must be\\r\\non the move in the next half hour. There is a chance that the French\\r\\nmay retreat beyond the village, so as to force the enemy out of their\\r\\ntrenches into the open fields. Come, we must run for it. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see\\r\\nhow we shall ever manage to get to our home and back in such a short\\r\\ntime. But we can help to bring up the rear.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNona slipped her arm through Barbara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and the two girls started back\\r\\nfor \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe House with the Blue Front Door.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIV _The Parting of the Ways_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two girls reached the farmhouse in a shorter time than they had\\r\\nbelieved possible and at once rushed upstairs to their rooms. There\\r\\nthey dragged out their suit-cases, and Mildred\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as well,\\r\\nand began packing them with the clothes they felt to be absolutely\\r\\nnecessary for their work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey knew the wounded must first be removed from the field hospital,\\r\\nwith only the nurse and doctors who would have charge of them. But\\r\\nthere would also be other motor cars to transport the additional\\r\\nnurses, physicians and hospital assistants. Moreover, since all the\\r\\ntents and the supplies must afterwards be gotten away this would surely\\r\\nrequire a fair amount of time. So in case they were late and missed the\\r\\nfirst of the departing cars, they would certainly be stored away in one\\r\\nof the later ones.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do wish we had asked Eugenia and Mildred to wait until we returned\\r\\nto the hospital before they leave,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbara called from beneath the bed\\r\\nin Mildred\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room, where she was dragging out a pair of shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have made any difference if we had asked,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nona answered.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMildred is to go in one of the first motor ambulances with the\\r\\nwounded, as she has charge of two critically ill soldiers. And of\\r\\ncourse Eugenia will do whatever she thinks wisest. Certainly she won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nwait for us if she thinks it best to go first.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not so sure of that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbara replied, and then there was a\\r\\nsilence lasting for several moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfterwards Barbara and Nona wondered why they were not more frightened\\r\\nduring this half hour. The fact is that they had not yet appreciated\\r\\nthe seriousness of the French retreat, nor the great task of moving the\\r\\nfield hospital beyond the present danger line.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, they were too busy to think clearly on any subject, and a\\r\\ntime of action is seldom a time of fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nExcept for the two girls moving hastily about, the little farmhouse\\r\\nwas delightfully quiet and peaceful after the dreadful morning at the\\r\\nhospital. Once the thought flashed through Barbara Meade\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf\\r\\nonly they might stay here in the little \\xe2\\x80\\x98House with the Blue Front\\r\\nDoor\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and take their chances with the enemy!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d They would be under the\\r\\nprotection of the Red Cross. However, as they had received their orders\\r\\nfrom an authority higher than Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, like soldiers they must do as\\r\\nthey were commanded, without considering their personal inclinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Barbara, having finished Mildred\\xe2\\x80\\x99s packing, took her suit-case\\r\\ndownstairs by the front door. She then went up for Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, which\\r\\nNona had by this time completed. It was heavier than the other and she\\r\\nstaggered a little and had to stop to recover her breath after she had\\r\\nplaced it alongside Mildred\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, she chanced to be standing just beside the front door when\\r\\nthe first knocking on the outside began. Nona had drawn a great,\\r\\nold-fashioned bolt across the door after entering, chiefly with the\\r\\nidea that they should not be disturbed at their tasks.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara did not open the door at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis knocking was not of an ordinary kind, such as one would expect\\r\\nfrom a visitor. It was very insistent, never stopping for a second; it\\r\\nwas indeed, a kind of hurried tattoo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho is there?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbara demanded. But before any one else could reply\\r\\nNona called from upstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlease don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t open the door, Barbara, at least not until we are about\\r\\nto start. There isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t an instant to waste in talking to any one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn consequence Barbara turned away, but immediately after she\\r\\nrecognized the voice of old Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOpen, open!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he shouted, first in French and then in English, having\\r\\nacquired a few words from his four American girl friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Barbara drew back the latch and Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois tumbled in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old fellow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brown face was ashen and the pupils of his little\\r\\nblack eyes were dilated with fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had evidently been running until he was almost out of breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe French are retreating, all our army at once: They are tramping,\\r\\ntramping through the fields and the woods. Madame the Countess says you\\r\\nare to come to the chateau immediately. Soon the Germans will be here\\r\\nand then----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old French peasant flung out his withered hands and rolled his eyes\\r\\nupward. Words failed to express his pent-up emotions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Barbara shook her head quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are very kind, Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois. Tell the Countess Am\\xc3\\xa9lie we are most\\r\\ngrateful for her thought of us. But we are going to the rear with the\\r\\nfield hospital staff and in any case we should be safe as Red Cross\\r\\nnurses. Go back to her now, for she needs you more than we do. This\\r\\nmust be a terrible experience for her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois straightened his crooked back against the front door,\\r\\nwhich he had most carefully closed after entering.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you must come and at once, Mademoiselle. For the Countess is ill,\\r\\nperhaps dying from the shock of the news we have just received,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ninsisted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHer son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, Captain Henri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, regiment has been destroyed.\\r\\nSome of the men have been taken prisoners, the others killed or\\r\\nwounded. And we have had no word from our young captain since the\\r\\nfighting began.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old servant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face worked with emotion and his eyes filled with\\r\\ntears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, I am so sorry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbara murmured pitifully, and then realizing the\\r\\ninadequacy of words at such a time, turned to Nona, who had at this\\r\\ninstant come downstairs, carrying her own and Barbara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bags.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat shall we do, Nona?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbara demanded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe should have started\\r\\nback to the field hospital before this. And yet if we go now and leave\\r\\nthe Countess ill with no one to look after her, it seems too cruel!\\r\\nSuppose I go with Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois and you return to the hospital and explain\\r\\nwhat has delayed me. Tell Eugenia where I am. Somehow I feel that\\r\\nperhaps the Countess Am\\xc3\\xa9lie needs my care more than the soldiers do\\r\\ntoday. There are so many other nurses to look after them, while she is\\r\\nold and alone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNona\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dark eyes looked troubled, nevertheless she shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t agree with you, Barbara. We ought to be at our posts. We have\\r\\npromised our services to the soldiers; besides, I could not let you go\\r\\nalone to the Countess. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you know that when the German soldiers\\r\\noverrun this countryside the chateau will be one of the first places\\r\\nto be seized? It is the most important house in the neighborhood and\\r\\nthe German officers are sure to take up their headquarters there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nona\\r\\nheld out her hand to Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI too am sorrier than I can say, but we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do what you ask of us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nshe declared, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe must go back to our work. Please try and make the\\r\\nCountess Am\\xc3\\xa9lie understand. Now good-by, Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois, and may we meet\\r\\nagain in happier times. You must move away from the door and let us be\\r\\noff, for we are dreadfully late already from talking to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut old Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois did not stir.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have lived in Madame\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house, you have eaten of her food, and yet\\r\\nwhen she may be dying you will not serve her. Because you wear on your\\r\\narm the badge of the _Croix de Rouge_, does it mean that you care only\\r\\nfor soldiers? Because Madame is a woman and an old one, you feel no\\r\\ninterest in her! Truly if she dies this war will have killed her, for\\r\\none does not die only from wounds of the flesh.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blue eyes had slowly filled with tears during the old\\r\\npeasant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech. But now a resolute line formed about the corners of\\r\\nher pretty mouth that only showed there occasionally.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am going to the Countess, Nona,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she remarked quietly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must do\\r\\nwhatever your conscience prompts you to do. Mine tells me that we have\\r\\naccepted a great deal from the Countess and now she needs me more than\\r\\nany one else. If the hospital staff consider me a deserter, I cannot\\r\\nhelp it. Besides, I almost promised Eugenia that I would go to the\\r\\nCountess Am\\xc3\\xa9lie if the Germans conquered this part of the countryside.\\r\\nIt was for another reason I promised, but tell her, please, and she\\r\\nwill understand. Good-by; I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll join you as soon as possible. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nworry about me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara stooped and picked up her bag.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find my way to the chateau alone. Fortunately, I know the way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nshe added. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFran\\xc3\\xa7ois, you must go with Miss Davis, so as to carry\\r\\nthe other suit-cases. Then you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll come back to Madame as quickly as\\r\\npossible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking a watch out of her pocket, Nona now glanced at it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am coming with you, Barbara. Already we are nearly an hour behind\\r\\nthe time when the field hospital expected to be on its way. If I return\\r\\nnow I shall either find that everybody and everything has departed,\\r\\nor else it will merely be an additional trouble to dispose of me at\\r\\nthe last. A day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loss of _my_ services cannot make such a great\\r\\ndifference. So we can first find out how greatly the Countess Am\\xc3\\xa9lie\\r\\nneeds us, and then tomorrow, one or both of us must somehow manage to\\r\\nrejoin the army. The French retreat may not be so universal as we fear.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time the blue front door had been flung open by Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois,\\r\\nso that outside the girls could hear the tramping of many feet. But\\r\\nthe feet were moving with a rhythmical swing that proved the French\\r\\nsoldiers were at least retreating in good order. So far there had been\\r\\nno rout by the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois was in the greatest hurry of the three. He had taken\\r\\nBarbara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bag out of her hand and now laid hold of Nona\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Then he set\\r\\noff, trotting so rapidly down the path, in spite of his age and crooked\\r\\nlegs, that the two girls could scarcely keep up with him. Afterwards he\\r\\nled their way into the woods, skirting along by the edge of the trees\\r\\nand keeping safely out of sight of the soldiers, although numbers of\\r\\nthem were marching through the same woods on the farther side.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was by this time early in the afternoon, but the girls found the\\r\\nchateau undisturbed. Indeed, the autumn sun shone down upon it with\\r\\nthe same tranquillity as though the world had been at peace instead of\\r\\nwar. Across the neglected lawn a peacock stalked as majestically and\\r\\ndisdainfully as if the old gardens had been filled with the belles and\\r\\nbeaus in the silks and satins of a more picturesque age.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the two American girls were living in a too tragically\\r\\nworkaday world. They had no thought and no time for beauty, since a\\r\\nshorter and more compelling word urged them on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lower part of the old chateau was deserted, and as neither Nona nor\\r\\nBarbara knew the way upstairs, Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois preceded them. He opened first\\r\\nthe door of the Countess Am\\xc3\\xa9lie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room, but found it empty. Without\\r\\nhesitating, he then turned and walked quickly down a narrow corridor to\\r\\nanother room at almost the opposite end of the house. Knocking at this\\r\\ndoor and receiving no answer, he crept in softly, beckoning to the two\\r\\ngirls to follow him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this room was so vast that neither Nona nor Barbara immediately\\r\\ndiscovered its occupant. Evidently it was a man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room and must have\\r\\ncovered the entire southern end of the chateau. Yet it was almost bare\\r\\nof furniture of a conventional kind. On the walls old muskets hung and\\r\\nbayonets of a bygone generation. The floor was of stone, uncarpeted,\\r\\nand there were only two chairs, a tall chest of drawers and a single\\r\\niron bed in the apartment. If the young Captain Castaigne was a dandy,\\r\\nas Eugenia considered him, certainly there was nothing about his room\\r\\nto suggest it!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Barbara was first to reach the bed, because she first saw that\\r\\nthe Countess Am\\xc3\\xa9lie had thrown herself upon it. She may have fainted\\r\\nearlier in the day and thus alarmed Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois, but at present she\\r\\nshowed no signs of serious illness. Her face was drawn with suffering,\\r\\nnevertheless she attempted to rise and speak to her guests as soon\\r\\nas Barbara approached. The Countess Am\\xc3\\xa9lie belonged to the ancient\\r\\naristocracy of France whose women went to the guillotine with smiles\\r\\nupon their faces. It was a part of their pride of class not to betray\\r\\ntheir deeper emotions.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet Barbara found the small hand held out to her extremely cold, and it\\r\\nwas with an effort that the older woman found herself able to stand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am more than glad you have been able to reach the chateau, Miss\\r\\nMeade,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she began. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoubtless you know as well as I do that our\\r\\nFrench army is in retreat and that the German army may occupy this\\r\\nneighborhood at any hour. But where are your other two friends? I\\r\\npromised my son that in case of danger I would send for you. He could\\r\\nnot contemplate the thought of your being alone if the barbarians\\r\\noverwhelmed us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Countess spoke quietly enough, yet there was bitter antagonism in\\r\\nher voice. One could hardly expect a French woman to feel otherwise\\r\\nat an hour like this. Remember also that this was a portion of France\\r\\nnear the border of Alsace-Lorraine, which the Germans took as a part of\\r\\ntheir booty at the close of the Franco-Prussian war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French people had not recovered from the bitterness of that defeat\\r\\nwhen the great war began.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara was looking somewhat nonplussed at finding that the Countess\\r\\nwas not in need of her services as a nurse, so she allowed Nona to join\\r\\nher and make the first reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were under the impression that you were ill and needed us, or we\\r\\nshould not have come,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nona answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe field hospital has been\\r\\nmoved and we intended leaving with them, so we should have been as safe\\r\\nas possible. Our friends, Miss Thornton and Miss Peabody, have gone on\\r\\nwith the staff. Still, we appreciate your wishing to protect us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nended gently.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn reality, both Nona and Barbara were deeply chagrined at the position\\r\\nin which they now found themselves. Yet there was no doubt that the\\r\\nolder woman had meant to be kind. Besides, nothing could be gained by\\r\\nmaking a protest now.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth girls accompanied the Countess Am\\xc3\\xa9lie out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am alone here, except for Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf the Germans\\r\\ncome this way, doubtless my chateau will be one of the first places\\r\\nwhich they will require for their own use. Therefore, it is necessary\\r\\nthat we be ready to leave at once. You need not be frightened;\\r\\nFran\\xc3\\xa7ois, will go with us, and there is a secret passage leading away\\r\\nfrom the chateau, through which we can make our escape without danger.\\r\\nI am going to ask you to help me pack a small store of provisions, as I\\r\\nthink we will be happier with work to occupy our hands.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNot a word of her anguish over her son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s uncertain fate, nor a protest\\r\\nat being forced in her old age to turn her back upon the home of her\\r\\nancestors! Surely this was aristocracy of the spirit as well as of\\r\\nclass, Nona and Barbara both thought to themselves, although neither\\r\\nsaid a word to the other upon the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat afternoon, between five and six o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock, Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois brought word\\r\\nthat the German army had captured the last line of French trenches and\\r\\nwould soon overflow into the countryside.\\r\\n\\r\\nTen minutes later the Countess Am\\xc3\\xa9lie, Nona, Barbara and Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois,\\r\\nvoluntarily deserting the chateau, started upon an uncertain journey to\\r\\novertake the retreating French army.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XV _The Other Two Girls_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as Nona and Barbara had anticipated, Mildred Thornton rode away\\r\\nwith her two patients in one of the first motor ambulances that\\r\\nhurriedly withdrew from the field hospital to remove the wounded from\\r\\nthe scene of danger. But by another strange mischance Eugenia was left\\r\\nbehind.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had, of course, continued to assist with the hospital work so\\r\\nlong as there was anything for her to do. However, she had previously\\r\\ninsisted that she be allowed to depart in one of the last of the motor\\r\\nvans. For the truth is she was unwilling to desert the neighborhood\\r\\nuntil Nona and Barbara, having returned from the farmhouse, were able\\r\\nto go along with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo during the last quarter of an hour, when only the tents were left\\r\\nto be piled upon the last trucks, Eugenia, having no more duties to\\r\\nperform, wandered a short distance away. She only went about an eighth\\r\\nof a mile along the path that led in the direction of the farmhouse\\r\\nand there sat down under a tree to wait for the other two girls and to\\r\\nwatch for a prearranged signal.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil she began to rest Eugenia really had no idea of how tired she\\r\\nwas. She had been up and at work since five o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock that morning under\\r\\nconditions that would have exhausted the strongest person in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow there were deafening noises reverberating all about her, while\\r\\nover her head hung a heavy pall of smoke, sometimes darkening the\\r\\natmosphere, but now and then lifting enough to permit a shaft of light\\r\\nfrom the November sun to shine through.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt present the firing suggested that the fighting was still at some\\r\\ndistance away, nevertheless the girl realized that the battle must be\\r\\ndrawing nearer and nearer, for already a portion of the retreating\\r\\nFrench army had passed within sight of the disbanded hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia was not conscious of being as greatly depressed by the French\\r\\ndefeat as the other three American Red Cross girls had been. Her chief\\r\\nthought was the appalling increase of the wounded that this day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nbattle must have caused. At this moment there must be hundreds, perhaps\\r\\nthousands of boys and men lying wounded and dying in the fields and\\r\\ntrenches with no one to bring them aid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf only one could do _more_ to help!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the girl murmured, clasping her\\r\\nhands wearily together in her lap, but at the same time keeping her\\r\\neyes fixed upon the path ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy in the world don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t those children come on?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she next asked\\r\\nimpatiently. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly they should not have been trusted to undertake\\r\\nour packing. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t doubt they are putting our new Paris clothes into\\r\\nthe bags!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she made this speech, believing that she heard some one approaching,\\r\\nEugenia half rose. Then the next instant she was up and standing with\\r\\nher back braced against the tree, upon which she had been previously\\r\\nresting. For bounding toward her, with his tongue hanging out and his\\r\\nhead lolling from side to side, was the dog belonging to Captain Henri\\r\\nCastaigne.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter her past experience it was impossible for Eugenia not to feel\\r\\nnervous, for the silver-gray brute was of enormous size and strength.\\r\\nYet when the dog reached her side, for the second time he crouched down\\r\\nat Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feet. This time, however, instead of hanging _down_ his\\r\\nhead, he turned his gray-brown eyes upward upon the girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s with such a\\r\\ndepth of entreaty that, without knowing why, she was moved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is all right, Duke, I forgive you all the past, even if I have not\\r\\nforgiven your master!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed, speaking in a friendly tone,\\r\\nalthough scorning to use the dog\\xe2\\x80\\x99s French name. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut do run home now to\\r\\nyour mistress. For this, I trust, is a final farewell between us, as we\\r\\nshall probably never meet again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEven though she spoke thus lightly, Eugenia was conscious that there\\r\\nmight be a possible tragedy in the fact that Duke could not return to\\r\\nhis master. Perhaps Captain Castaigne was even now among the missing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the great Dane gave no sign of having heard Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncommand, but instead gave her another look of profound appeal. When\\r\\nshe showed no indication of having understood his meaning, he got up\\r\\nand caught her dress firmly between his teeth. Then not ungently but\\r\\nauthoritatively he began dragging her along with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first moment Eugenia was too surprised to make any special\\r\\nresistance. The next she called out angrily to the dog to let go; and\\r\\nthen, finding he had no idea of obeying her, tore her coat from between\\r\\nhis clenched teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s answer was to gaze at her reproachfully and then to gather a\\r\\nlarger portion of her clothing in his mouth and start off faster the\\r\\nsecond time, with the girl obliged to follow.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally Eugenia was angry. This objectionable dog appeared designed\\r\\nby fate to be a nuisance to her. Yet she was unable to make up her mind\\r\\nwhat to do. She could tear herself away again with another disastrous\\r\\nresult to her clothing; besides, the dog would doubtless seize hold\\r\\non her again. And to struggle with the enormous creature could only\\r\\nbring misfortune upon herself, since there was no doubt of Duke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndetermination.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo for twenty yards or more Eugenia moved along without further\\r\\nprotest, then she concluded to call and summon some one to her\\r\\nassistance. No one chanced to be in sight, but there were, of course,\\r\\nseveral of the hospital workers not far away, so that in case Duke\\r\\nturned dangerous a shot would quickly put an end to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this thought in mind Eugenia again looked at the dog. He was such\\r\\na magnificent creature it would be a tragedy to kill him. Besides, was\\r\\nshe not so sick at heart at all the unnecessary waste of death that she\\r\\nwould not voluntarily destroy the tiniest spark of life?\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething of this feeling must have at this instant communicated itself\\r\\nto Duke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intelligence, for suddenly and of his own accord he released\\r\\nEugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dress. But instead of leaving her he walked on a few steps\\r\\nfurther, stopped, turned around again and made a second appeal and\\r\\nthen went slowly on a few feet more.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfterwards Eugenia decided that she must have been abnormally dull at\\r\\nthis time. But then her attention had been so concentrated upon the\\r\\nhope of Barbara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Nona\\xe2\\x80\\x99s immediate return. For it was not until\\r\\nDuke had made his third demand that his purpose finally occurred to\\r\\nher. Of course, he wished her to go with him to find some lost place or\\r\\nperson.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia never considered the possible distance that she might be\\r\\nexpected to travel, for all at once she seemed curiously under the\\r\\ndomination of the dog\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desire. For she straightway put her hand\\r\\nreassuringly upon Duke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s collar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is all right, old fellow, I understand at last and will come along\\r\\nwith you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen in a perfectly matter-of-fact fashion Eugenia moved along by\\r\\nthe dog\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side. Soon after she knew that he was leading her in the\\r\\ndirection of the French trenches which were directly within the firing\\r\\nline. However, it did not strike her that she was facing any greater\\r\\nperil than she and the field hospital staff had been enduring all day.\\r\\nFor one grows accustomed to war\\xe2\\x80\\x99s horrors as well as to most other\\r\\nthings.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, Eugenia flinched many times as the dog led the way,\\r\\nwalking now and then beside men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bodies that did not stir either at\\r\\ntheir approach or after their passing. Yet Red Cross nurses must learn\\r\\na certain amount of stoicism to be of real value in their work.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce or twice Eugenia wondered if she could possibly manage to finish\\r\\nthe task Duke required of her in time to leave with the last of the\\r\\nfield hospital staff, yet it was odd how secondary this idea became.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome other guiding force had taken possession of her at the time, for\\r\\nthe purpose in hand seemed the one thing supremely worth while.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly through one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s imagination can the picture of a battlefield be\\r\\nreally seen, for even when the eyes behold it, the spirit must act as\\r\\nits interpreter.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor nearly a year Eugenia had been nursing the soldiers in this worst\\r\\nof all possible wars, yet it was not until this afternoon that she had\\r\\never visited a battleground while the fighting was going on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut fortunately the field to which Duke brought her was no longer a\\r\\ncenter of the firing. The field lay just behind a trench which but a\\r\\nfew hours before had been a target for German artillery. However, the\\r\\ntrench had already been captured, so that many of the soldiers who lay\\r\\ndead upon the ground had been killed during their effort to retreat.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore the accident that occurred was not one which could have been\\r\\nreasonably expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith his great head bowed Duke was treading slowly, as if he realized\\r\\nthe ugliness of the human tragedy surrounding them. Neither was Eugenia\\r\\nthinking of herself; nevertheless, a moment later and she lay stretched\\r\\nupon the battleground, as still and unconscious as any of the recumbent\\r\\nfigures by whom she had so lately passed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere for hours Duke stood sentinel beside her, yet not knowing whether\\r\\nhe should go or remain. For while love compelled him in one direction,\\r\\nhis sense of honor constrained him to stay by the companion who had\\r\\nfallen by his side.\\r\\n\\r\\nDid Duke realize his own responsibility in the catastrophe, that his\\r\\nhonor prevailed?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire afternoon passed and finally evening came and yet Eugenia\\r\\ndid not stir. She looked an incongruous figure on the field of the\\r\\ndead. For although she wore her nursing cloak it had floated open as\\r\\nshe fell, revealing her woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s uniform with the cross of crimson upon\\r\\nher arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVI _The Discovery_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut between eight and nine o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock on that same evening Eugenia opened\\r\\nher eyes. She was unable to think clearly at first and stared in\\r\\namazement at the canopy of blue sky above her head. What had become of\\r\\nthe familiar ceiling of her room at the farmhouse?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut then her head was aching dully so that it made her more\\r\\nuncomfortable to try to think at all. She did not even wish to call for\\r\\nthe other girls, because Barbara would probably come to her in a little\\r\\nwhile. She remembered that Barbara had been especially kind when she\\r\\nhad just such another absurd headache a short time before.\\r\\n\\r\\nClosing her eyes again, Eugenia rested. But something warm and soft\\r\\nseemed to be moving about near her face, breathing over her in a\\r\\ncurious, enveloping fashion impossible from a human being. It was like\\r\\na damp cloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nPutting out her hand, Eugenia touched Duke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s moist nose, and then\\r\\nalmost instantly returned to a knowledge of the situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe recalled in detail the events of the past afternoon, but could\\r\\nfind no explanation for her own presence here upon the ground among\\r\\nthe wounded. For she was not suffering sufficient pain to suggest\\r\\nthat she had been shot by a stray rifle ball from the enemy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lines.\\r\\nMoreover, Eugenia found that she could move both her arms and legs\\r\\nwithout difficulty. They were stiff, but that may have been due either\\r\\nto fatigue or to her position upon the earth. However, the ache in her\\r\\nhead continued so that Eugenia put up her fingers to her temple. There\\r\\nwas a curious something clotted on her hair at the left side, which she\\r\\nat once knew to be blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she understood what had happened. A piece of shell from an\\r\\nexploding bomb must have struck and stunned her into unconsciousness.\\r\\nHowever, it must have come from such a distance that it had spent its\\r\\nforce, for she was not seriously injured. Already the slight scalp\\r\\nwound had closed and was no longer bleeding.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia rose up slowly to a sitting position, realizing fully the\\r\\ngravity of her situation. Yet she would not allow herself to reflect\\r\\nupon its horrors. She must decide what she should best do. Would it be\\r\\nwiser to stay where she was for the rest of the night or try to seek\\r\\nassistance? Yet what had taken place in the countryside during the\\r\\nafternoon while she lay in a stupor? Were the French or the Germans in\\r\\npossession of the neighborhood?\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Eugenia was not to be allowed to reach her decision alone. For\\r\\nno sooner had she gotten up than Duke once more began pulling at her\\r\\ndress, very softly at first, as one who has respect for an invalid, but\\r\\nno less insistently.\\r\\n\\r\\nA dog\\xe2\\x80\\x99s devotion and a dog\\xe2\\x80\\x99s persistence are two qualities worthy of\\r\\nhuman admiration and wonder.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment Eugenia felt both. She laid her hand quietly and\\r\\naffectionately on Duke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go with you again. I am too used up, Duke, to help you find\\r\\nyour friend. You would simply have another victim on your hands. But\\r\\nyou need stay with _me_ no longer. I shall wait here for you until\\r\\ndaylight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though Eugenia waved her hand in token of dismissal and farewell,\\r\\nthe dog did not leave her, although he seemed to appreciate the fact\\r\\nthat she was unable to accompany him. For he gave up his hold on her\\r\\nand merely sat down reflectively by her side, as if he too were trying\\r\\nto decide what course it was wise to pursue.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was plain that Duke was wretchedly unhappy. If he could not show his\\r\\ngrief in a human fashion, he had his own especial methods. When Eugenia\\r\\nput her arm about his body she could feel the anguished beating of his\\r\\nheart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wonder who it can be, Duke, that you wish to find so ardently?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the\\r\\ngirl questioned. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSurely some one whom you love very deeply! I am sorry\\r\\nto be so useless and it is dreadful to think of your friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long\\r\\nwaiting for your return, so you must go, Duke, even if I cannot go\\r\\nwith you. Then if you are no longer needed, come back to me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia made this long speech aloud in a pleading tone, nevertheless\\r\\nshe again discovered that it was easier to say what this great dog\\r\\nshould do than to force him to obey one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet while Eugenia was reflecting upon this fact she had her moment of\\r\\ninspiration. She knew that in many parts of the army dogs had been\\r\\ntrained for searching out the wounded. Only a short time before in the\\r\\npapers distributed by the French Red Cross Society she had read that\\r\\nthese dogs were sent forth with long ropes tied about their necks, so\\r\\nthat when possible the wounded were thus dragged to places of aid.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia had no rope, but one often wonders why women are accused of\\r\\nbeing without inventive talents. So far it is true that only a few of\\r\\ntheir inventions have been of world value; to find them one must seek\\r\\namong the homes. This American girl at once slipped off her long cloth\\r\\nnursing coat. It was of strong, well-woven material, yet she managed\\r\\nwithin a few moments to tear it into strips and then to knot the strips\\r\\nfirmly together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she tied the long cord about Duke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s neck. One could not tell\\r\\nwhether the dog would understand his mission, or whether the rope would\\r\\nbe of service when Duke reached his goal. Yet in every uncertainty in\\r\\nlife one must simply attempt the thing that seems most intelligent. And\\r\\nEugenia felt convinced that Duke would bring his friend back to her.\\r\\nThen she could decide on what should be done next.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuke did seem to understand, for as soon as Eugenia had finished her\\r\\ntask and commanded him to be gone, he trotted obediently off until his\\r\\ngreat shadow was lost in the distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the girl lay down again. She had natural self-control and her\\r\\nnursing had taught her even more. She must sleep if possible and in any\\r\\ncase not let herself dwell on her own presence here within the field of\\r\\nthe dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Eugenia closed her eyes the moon had not risen and the night was\\r\\nfairly dark. Half an hour later, when she reopened them, a full moon\\r\\nhad flooded the field with light. She could see Duke approaching at\\r\\nsome yards away. He was moving slowly and it was difficult at first\\r\\nto find out the reason. Eugenia rose quickly to her feet. Yes, it was\\r\\nevident now: he _was_ drawing someone along behind him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl walked forward to meet the dog and his burden. Then, although\\r\\nshe had been growing daily more accustomed to war and its inevitable\\r\\nsorrows, she stopped and drew in her breath sharply. The next instant\\r\\nEugenia had forgotten everything but that she was a Red Cross nurse\\r\\nwhose purpose was to do whatever she could to relieve suffering.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figure that the dog dragged along on the ground had the face turned\\r\\ndownward. But when she lifted the body up Eugenia was not surprised to\\r\\nrecognize in the white, still features, the face of young Captain Henri\\r\\nCastaigne. All along she had thought it probable that Duke could feel\\r\\nno such intense devotion for any one save his master.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the dog\\xe2\\x80\\x99s return the young officer had somehow managed to tie the\\r\\nlong strip of cloth about his own body. He must have realized that he\\r\\nwould lose consciousness on his journey to find succor, for he had been\\r\\ncruelly wounded in both legs.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever before had Eugenia felt more painfully helpless. There were so\\r\\nmany things which should be done for the young soldier at once and she\\r\\nwas so unable to do any one of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, she knelt and felt the action of his pulse and heart,\\r\\nfinding neither so feeble as she had feared. Then Eugenia, who was\\r\\ngiven to definite actions, made another decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be impossible to be of service to Captain Castaigne here in\\r\\nan open field with no water near, so far as she knew. She had a little\\r\\nin the canteen in her pocket, but this would only be enough for him\\r\\nto drink and would certainly be insufficient for the cleansing of his\\r\\nwounds. Besides, even with the use of the small flashlight every Red\\r\\nCross nurse carries, she was unable to discover whether the rifle\\r\\nballs were still imbedded in her patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s flesh. Certainly he must be\\r\\ncarried to some place where he could receive proper attention, but in\\r\\nthe meantime Eugenia thanked Providence that she had with her her bag\\r\\nof first aid appliances. It had been strapped about her waist while she\\r\\nsat under the tree earlier in the day, waiting to start out with the\\r\\nfield hospital staff. Until now she had no thought or use for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia used the necessary antiseptics and then bound the wounds as\\r\\ncarefully as possible. But she made no effort to bring her patient back\\r\\nto consciousness. For the purpose she had in mind it would be best that\\r\\nhe feel and know as little as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce her task accomplished Eugenia again wound her improvised rope\\r\\nabout Captain Castaigne\\xe2\\x80\\x99s waist. Again she signaled Duke to start upon\\r\\na journey, but this time she formed a member of the little party.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer idea was to get the wounded officer back in the neighborhood of\\r\\nthe field hospital, and then if she could find no aid there, somehow\\r\\nto reach their own farmhouse. From there word could be sent to the\\r\\nchateau.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the trip was a terrible one and took longer hours than one could\\r\\nhave imagined. Now and then Eugenia would try to assist by supporting\\r\\nthe young officer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s body with her own strength. But as she could not\\r\\nlift him entirely this only seemed to make the task more difficult for\\r\\nthe devoted Duke. Often they were obliged to stop and then Eugenia\\r\\nwould kneel down beside the body to find out if the young man was still\\r\\nalive.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was about dawn when they arrived at last in the neighborhood of the\\r\\nformer French field hospital, where the four American girls had been\\r\\nnursing. But Eugenia found few traces of the hospital left. Everywhere\\r\\nin the vicinity the ground had been trampled under foot. The white\\r\\ntents had been folded, and like the proverbial Arabian tents, had\\r\\nsilently stolen away. Neither was there a single human being about.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Eugenia had anticipated this. But she had also steadfastly\\r\\nhoped that here upon more familiar ground she might make some useful\\r\\ndiscovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrdering Duke to remain quiet beside his burden, Eugenia started upon a\\r\\npilgrimage. She must find something to make the trip to the farmhouse\\r\\nmore endurable, more possible for the young French soldier. Yet she\\r\\ncould not make up her mind to desert him in order to seek for help.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first, the girl could, of course, find nothing. But by wandering\\r\\naround on the outskirts of the grounds, where the deserted hospital had\\r\\nformerly stood, Eugenia finally came across an old wheelbarrow. It had\\r\\nbeen used for bringing vegetables to the hospital staff, and being of\\r\\nno value had been left behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely an ideal motor ambulance for a wounded officer. Nevertheless\\r\\nEugenia seized upon the wheelbarrow with almost as much enthusiasm as\\r\\nif it had been. For at least it had wheels and she would be able to\\r\\npush it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally this was a hard task, but one should not think upon the\\r\\ndifficulty when a task is to be accomplished.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blue front door of the little farmhouse was standing open when\\r\\nEugenia reached home. Half lifting and half dragging her patient, she\\r\\nfinally succeeded in placing him upon a small couch in their living\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, being the methodical person she was, Eugenia went directly to the\\r\\nkitchen, made herself a cup of coffee and drank it. For her strength\\r\\nhad almost given out and she knew not what work might lie ahead of her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVII _Recognition_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, it was nearly noon before Eugenia made the discovery that\\r\\nthe entire French army in the vicinity had retreated, leaving all\\r\\nthe country nearby in the hands of the Germans. Only then did she\\r\\nappreciate the difficulty of concealing a young French officer in her\\r\\nhome, who would doubtless be taken prisoner if his presence and his\\r\\nidentity were discovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer information came about in this fashion. For two hours Eugenia\\r\\nworked with her patient, washing his wounds and even managing to\\r\\nextract a bullet which had lodged near the surface. Also she bathed his\\r\\nface and poured brandy between his haggard lips until he opened his\\r\\neyes, only to close them again in utter exhaustion. Finally, when she\\r\\ncould do nothing more, Eugenia walked to her front door to get some\\r\\nfresh air. She meant in a few moments to go to the Chateau d\\xe2\\x80\\x99Am\\xc3\\xa9lie and\\r\\nsend old Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois to the nearest village for a doctor. So far it simply\\r\\nhad not occurred to her that Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois and his mistress might have\\r\\ndeserted the chateau for the same reason that had compelled the removal\\r\\nof the field hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside, like a tired sentinel, Eugenia found Duke asleep in the front\\r\\nyard. Then while hesitating to wake him, even to keep guard over his\\r\\nmaster, she became vaguely conscious that soldiers were marching past.\\r\\nThe next instant she realized that their uniforms were German and not\\r\\nFrench and that they wore the eagle triumphant on their shining helmets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were passing close to the little \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHouse with the Blue Front Door,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nso that Eugenia wondered why no one stopped to investigate it. Then she\\r\\nremembered that Barbara had hung the Red Cross emblem outside and that\\r\\nthe soldiers were treating it with extraordinary respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould they continue to do this after discovering that the only person\\r\\nbeside herself under the protection of the Red Cross flag was an\\r\\nenemy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s officer?\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia was convinced otherwise. Captain Castaigne would be promptly\\r\\ntaken prisoner so soon as she told of his whereabouts and sent to a\\r\\nhospital within the German lines. And to be moved at the present time\\r\\nwould probably mean the young officer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalling Duke inside, Eugenia closed and bolted the blue front door.\\r\\nThen she considered whether she could manage to keep the young\\r\\nFrenchman concealed and yet take the proper care of him. It would be\\r\\nimpossible to expect the assistance of a physician, for the nearest\\r\\nvillage would assuredly be occupied by the Germans and to demand a\\r\\ndoctor must mean the betrayal of her patient.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was possible, however, that she could hide Captain Castaigne away\\r\\nfor a time at least, while she remained unmolested in the little\\r\\nfarmhouse, with Duke as her protector. She would explain to the German\\r\\nofficer in command just what had taken place that caused her to be left\\r\\nbehind by the hospital staff. Then there would be little reason for\\r\\ninterfering with her, unless the farmhouse should be required for the\\r\\nshelter of the soldiers. But as it was small and somewhat out of the\\r\\nway she hoped it might be ignored.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chiefly important thing was to wait quietly until the next morning\\r\\nand then find out Captain Castaigne\\xe2\\x80\\x99s condition. Eugenia meant to make\\r\\nas brave a fight for his life as possible. If he recovered there would\\r\\nbe time enough to determine whether he should surrender or make an\\r\\neffort to escape and rejoin his command. Fortunately there were both\\r\\nprovisions and medical supplies stored in the farmhouse. Judge Thornton\\r\\nhad sent fresh orders of both from Paris quite recently.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo for the rest of the afternoon and evening Eugenia sat by her patient\\r\\nwhile Duke crouched on the floor near them both. No one disturbed them;\\r\\nthe little house might have been in the center of a vast desert for\\r\\nany human interest it created. The day before Eugenia had closed its\\r\\noutside windows and doors, and since had opened only the one window\\r\\nnecessary for light and air.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the greater part of the night Captain Castaigne was delirious from\\r\\na high fever. Eugenia knew that it would be almost impossible for him\\r\\nto escape blood poison, after the dirt had been ground into his wounds\\r\\nfrom the long dragging of his body on the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, now and then the young officer slept the sleep of utter\\r\\nexhaustion, with Duke and Eugenia both slumbering beside him whenever\\r\\nthis opportunity came.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia did not question the reason for her care. She had not liked the\\r\\nyoung Frenchman at their first meeting in Paris. Certainly their second\\r\\naccidental meeting in the woods had not increased her liking. Moreover,\\r\\nshe had been entirely out of sympathy with him, with his mother and\\r\\nwith their French ideas and environment on the afternoon of her one\\r\\ncall.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet none of these things counted in the least with Eugenia. Captain\\r\\nCastaigne was a French soldier, one of the men whom she had come to\\r\\nEurope to nurse in case he needed her care. Therefore he should have\\r\\nthe best it was in her power to offer.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce, while in the act of giving him medicine to relieve his fever, the\\r\\nyoung man murmured his mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name and for the instant Eugenia was\\r\\nmoved to sympathy. All the rest of the time her feeling was entirely\\r\\nimpersonal. Captain Castaigne was merely a patient who must if possible\\r\\nbe kept alive and later restored to health. If she had any feeling in\\r\\nthe matter Eugenia was sorry that she had ever made the young man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nacquaintance before this night.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, at about six o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock the following morning, after an\\r\\nentire hour of refreshing sleep, Eugenia opened her eyes to find her\\r\\npatient gazing steadfastly at her. For the time being his delirium\\r\\nhad passed and she realized that he recognized her and longed to ask\\r\\nquestions but was still too weak and ill to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nA half an hour afterwards, after a few sips of clam bouillon which\\r\\nchanced to be among the household stores, Captain Castaigne said a few\\r\\nwords.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_What does this mean?_\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked in painstaking English, appreciating\\r\\neven in his present condition that Miss Peabody preferred the\\r\\nconversation to take place in her native tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia thought quickly. The young officer could not entirely grasp the\\r\\nsituation even if she were able to tell him the entire story. Moreover,\\r\\nat present the story was too long and too exciting for him to hear.\\r\\nAlso, he might feel burdened by his obligation to her and unwilling for\\r\\nher to make the sacrifices necessary for his safety if he learned the\\r\\ntruth now.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she gazed back at him with the quiet serenity that made her so\\r\\nvaluable a nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou understand you have been hurt? Well, I have been appointed to take\\r\\ncharge of you. You are to see no one else for a time, not even your\\r\\nmother. Try to sleep now, for you must be as quiet as possible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Captain Castaigne immediately closed his eyes, Eugenia choked back\\r\\na sigh of relief. Evidently so far he had paid no attention to his\\r\\nstrange surroundings. It was her presence alone that had surprised him,\\r\\nand he would probably be unable to make further inquiries for some time\\r\\nto come. Possibly he would not even recognize her again. For Eugenia\\r\\nunderstood the nature of the disease with which she was to do battle\\r\\nand realized that there might be weeks of continued delirium.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the next fourteen days Eugenia was correct in her prognostication.\\r\\nBut as they were a rather dreadful two weeks for her she would never\\r\\ntalk of them freely afterwards. All that time she had but faint hope\\r\\nthat the young soldier would live, and except for her patient and Duke\\r\\nshe was completely alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Eugenia managed to get the young fellow upstairs and into\\r\\nBarbara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s former blue bedroom, although he was never conscious of the\\r\\nchange.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was compelled to do this, or else have her patient discovered. For\\r\\nshe was not to remain entirely undisturbed while the victorious German\\r\\nsoldiers overran the entire neighborhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne afternoon, three days after their installation, when fortunately\\r\\nshe chanced to be working in her kitchen, a tremendous knocking\\r\\nsounded upon the blue front door. Immediately Eugenia conceived that\\r\\nit was some one sent to inquire why a solitary female should remain\\r\\nsequestered in a house, when supplies and houses were so much needed\\r\\nfor the German soldiers.\\r\\n\\r\\nA satisfactory explanation would doubtless be difficult; nevertheless\\r\\nEugenia, with a blue check gingham apron over her nursing one and a cup\\r\\nand saucer and dish towel in her hands, opened the front door.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was something which she hoped looked \\xe2\\x80\\x9cold maidy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in this\\r\\nsuggestion of dishes and tea. Nothing to suggest the concealment of a\\r\\nyoung French officer!\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside her door Eugenia encountered a stiff German youth in an\\r\\nimmaculate uniform, bearing an official letter. The letter commanded\\r\\nEugenia to report to the officer in authority in the nearest village.\\r\\nShe was to explain her presence in the neighborhood, her occupation,\\r\\nand above all offer proof of her nationality.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, before setting out the next morning Eugenia changed the\\r\\nquarters of her patient. There could be little doubt that some one\\r\\nwould be sent to investigate the interior of the little \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFarmhouse\\r\\nwith the Blue Front Door.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d One could scarcely expect to keep a soldier\\r\\nhidden in the only room of any size in the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nFortunately Barbara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room was the most inconspicuous of the four\\r\\nbedrooms. Besides, Eugenia had a certain scheme in mind which she hoped\\r\\nmight help when the critical moment arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally Eugenia had passports and certificates to identify herself as\\r\\nan American Red Cross nurse. But she also took with her to the colonel\\r\\nof the German regiment another paper of a different character. However,\\r\\nshe did not mean to show this before feeling her way very carefully.\\r\\nThe paper was a check for a large sum of money on an American bank in\\r\\nBoston and signed with her own name.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the improvised office of the German colonel, Eugenia told her story\\r\\nas briefly as possible. Moreover, she told the exact truth in regard\\r\\nto herself in every detail up to a certain moment. This was the moment\\r\\nwhen she awakened to consciousness after being struck by a German shell.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing antagonistic in Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s manner with the officer.\\r\\nShe explained to him that the little French farmhouse had been allotted\\r\\nto the use of the four American Red Cross nurses and that the other\\r\\nthree girls had retreated with the French field hospital staff. Then\\r\\nshe asked that she be allowed to remain in their house until such time\\r\\nas she could communicate with her friends in America. As she was alone\\r\\nit would be impossible to have German soldiers quartered upon her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment Eugenia put her hand upon the check in her pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery frankly she then declared that she realized it to be each person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nduty to assist with the shelter and feeding of a victorious army. But\\r\\nas she was unable to do either of these things, would not the colonel\\r\\naccept money instead? She trusted that he would not be offended by\\r\\nher unusual suggestion, for it appeared to her the only just and fair\\r\\nthing to do under the circumstances. Finally after further discussion\\r\\nand hesitation and another careful study of her passports, the German\\r\\nofficer agreed to do what Eugenia had suggested. However, he insisted,\\r\\nas a matter of necessary formality, that two German soldiers be sent\\r\\nto her house next day on a tour of inspection. When they came Eugenia\\r\\nhad the courage to show them into the very blue bedroom where the young\\r\\nFrench officer lay concealed. But beforehand, and in spite of her\\r\\nPuritan ancestry, she explained that this room was her own bedchamber.\\r\\nMoreover, to prove that she had nothing to keep secret she had entirely\\r\\nemptied her closet. Her own clothes, beside all those that the other\\r\\nthree girls had left behind, were thrown with pretended carelessness\\r\\non top the very bed where Captain Castaigne lay hidden under a pile of\\r\\nbedclothes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young Frenchman was in a stupor from fever at the time, so Eugenia\\r\\nconsidered that there could be little risk of his either moving or\\r\\nspeaking. However, if risk there was, she felt compelled to take it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German soldiers made no effort to give this special room a thorough\\r\\ninvestigation. They merely glanced in, and then, like the proverbial\\r\\nten thousand men of King George\\xe2\\x80\\x99s army, marched out again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this Eugenia was troubled no further by intruders from the ranks\\r\\nof the Allies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 enemy. Her next visitor was of a much more unexpected\\r\\ncharacter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVIII _Out of the Depth_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll one night Eugenia feared that Captain Castaigne would die.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the fourteenth night after the beginning of his fever and\\r\\na crisis in the disease. So for twenty-four hours she did not have\\r\\none-half hour of uninterrupted sleep. It was not because the young man\\r\\nneeded her constant care, for indeed he was never conscious of her\\r\\nexistence. When he called it was always to ask for some one else, and\\r\\nyet it was always Eugenia who answered. Then for a little while at\\r\\nleast the patient would seem to be satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if at their first accidental meeting in Paris the four American\\r\\nRed Cross girls had considered Captain Castaigne absurdly young for\\r\\nhis captain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s commission, what must they have thought of him now? To\\r\\nEugenia he appeared like a boy of sixteen.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is true that he had a tiny dark moustache, but except for this his\\r\\nface remained smooth. Then his nurse had been compelled to cut off\\r\\nall his dark hair in order to cool his head, and his slender body had\\r\\nbecome wasted and his eyes sunken. Indeed, the features, which Eugenia\\r\\nhad once considered too perfect for a man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, now frequently made her\\r\\nthink of a delicate cameo, when he lay with his face in profile against\\r\\nthe pure white of his pillow.\\r\\n\\r\\nWatching him on this night, which she feared might be his last, Eugenia\\r\\nfelt unusually moved.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all, he must have been a brave and capable fellow to have\\r\\nreceived his present rank in the French army while still so young.\\r\\nMoreover, there was a possibility that Captain Castaigne had more\\r\\nforce of character than she had ever given him credit for. Had he not\\r\\nrebelled against his mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ideas of rank and dignity, and in spite\\r\\nof his devotion to her refused to keep his title in a country which was\\r\\nnow a republic? Of course, Eugenia could not believe that the young\\r\\nman really had the true democratic spirit in which she so thoroughly\\r\\ntrusted. Still there was a chance that he might not be so futile a\\r\\ncharacter as she had first supposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaning over to wipe her patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face with a damp cloth, Eugenia\\r\\nmade up her mind to one thing. If Captain Castaigne died she would go\\r\\nat once to the German colonel in command of the French village and\\r\\nconfess what she had done. Of necessity she must be punished for her\\r\\nfalsehood and treachery, but surely she would be permitted to send for\\r\\nthe Countess Am\\xc3\\xa9lie at the last. The young French officer could be of\\r\\nno interest to his enemies after his death.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut where the Countess could be hiding, nor whom she could find to\\r\\nsend for her, Eugenia had not the faintest idea. For these past two\\r\\nweeks she had been so entirely shut away from the outside world. Except\\r\\nfor her one visit to the German colonel she had never left the little\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHouse with the Blue Front Door\\xe2\\x80\\x9d since the night she first brought her\\r\\npatient into it. Nor had Eugenia received a single line from any one\\r\\nof the other three Red Cross girls to afford her the faintest idea\\r\\nof what could have become of them. But she did not worry so much as\\r\\nshe might have done at a time when she was less occupied. Besides,\\r\\nnaturally she believed that the three girls were with the French field\\r\\nhospital at some point back of the line of the French army\\xe2\\x80\\x99s retreat.\\r\\n\\r\\nToward dawn Eugenia knew that the hour of greatest danger to her\\r\\npatient would arrive. For it is an acknowledged scientific fact that\\r\\nlife is at its lowest ebb with the rising and the setting of the sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, just before this time Eugenia left her patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bedside and\\r\\nwent into the room adjoining, which she used for her own needs. There\\r\\nshe washed her face and hands in cold water and, letting down her heavy\\r\\nhair, plaited it in two braids. She was very tired and yet must prepare\\r\\nherself to meet the coming hour with all the strength and wisdom she\\r\\ncould muster.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven as she made her toilet she was aware of the feverish muttering\\r\\nof the young officer. His stupor had passed several days before, but\\r\\nsince his nurse could not decide whether his weak restlessness and\\r\\nalmost incessant crying out were not worse symptoms. Certainly they\\r\\nwere more trying upon her nerves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMa m\\xc3\\xa8re, ma m\\xc3\\xa8re,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he was repeating his mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name over and over\\r\\nagain, as if he must see her again before his spirit could leave his\\r\\nbody.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia slipped back and for the hundredth time laid her hand gently\\r\\non the young fellow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brow. Somehow he must be quieted, comforted\\r\\ninto thinking his mother near him. Then if he never returned to\\r\\nconsciousness he would pass out of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s alarms with a sense of\\r\\nher presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you recall that Barbara Meade had discovered a wonderful, healing\\r\\nquality in the touch of Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hands? It is true that a few people\\r\\nhave this vital, health-giving quality in their hands, which is not\\r\\ntrue of others.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyhow, Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s patient grew quieter, although he still murmured a\\r\\nbroken word now and then. He was strangely pathetic, because, however\\r\\nmuch he might move his arms and the upper part of his body, his legs\\r\\nremained lifeless. For now and then when he had endeavored to change\\r\\nhis position the pain had been so great as to pierce through his stupor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMon fils, mon fils,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Eugenia whispered several times. It was all the\\r\\nFrench she dared permit herself to speak, and yet the simple words \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy\\r\\nson,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d even spoken by a New England old maid, carried their magic.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet Eugenia was looking little like an old maid as she leaned over the\\r\\nFrench boy--and he was scarcely more than a boy. She wore the violet\\r\\nwrapper, and as she kneeled her long dark braids of hair lay upon the\\r\\nfloor. She too had grown thin and white from her two weeks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 vigil of\\r\\nnursing, cooking, taking entire charge of her patient, herself and\\r\\nthe little house. Nevertheless, Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face had for some reason\\r\\nsoftened, perhaps because she was too weary and too selfless in her\\r\\ndevotion to her patient to feel superior to any earthly thing. At this\\r\\nmoment her eyes were both sad and hopeful, while her lashes looked\\r\\nlonger and darker than usual against the pallor of her cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally Captain Castaigne moved away from the soft pressure of his\\r\\nnurse\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hands. As he moved with more strength than Eugenia believed him\\r\\nto possess, for the next instant she watched him even more closely.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was muttering a number of confused phrases, now and then what\\r\\nsounded like a command to his soldiers. Then all at once he stopped and\\r\\nlaughed a little foolishly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEugenia Peabody,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he pronounced the words distinctly, although with\\r\\na French accent which made the name more attractive than it ever had\\r\\nbefore. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEugeni\\xc3\\xa9 Paybod\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was the way it sounded to its possessor.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia stared more closely. Could Captain Castaigne know her once\\r\\nagain? Since the first night after his injury he never seemed to have\\r\\nbeen aware of her identity.\\r\\n\\r\\nA further glance into his eyes showed this was not true. There was no\\r\\nsign of intelligence there, only vagueness and a confused groping in\\r\\nthe dark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMademoiselle Paybod\\xc3\\xa9, she is what you call in English \\xe2\\x80\\x98an old maid.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the young officer laughed boyishly, as if he and a friend had been\\r\\ndiscussing a new acquaintance and found the subject amusing.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia flushed. It was absurd, but for the moment she felt hurt and\\r\\nangry. Few of us like to be the subject of a joke and Eugenia was not\\r\\ngifted with much sense of humor. But a little later she had the grace\\r\\nto be ashamed of herself. However she might dislike the young Frenchman\\r\\nwhom she had been nursing so faithfully, she must remember that he had\\r\\nunfailing good manners. Their one unfortunate meeting had been due to a\\r\\nmistake on his part. Afterwards he had done all that he could to make\\r\\namends. Certainly he would be the last person to be rude to her under\\r\\nthe present circumstances if he had known what he was saying! Moreover,\\r\\nthe minute after he continued talking at random upon subjects which had\\r\\nno possible connection.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after, glancing at her watch, Eugenia got up and crossed the\\r\\nroom. The next instant she returned in order to take her patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ntemperature. His fever was not so high, but then his pulse and heart\\r\\nseemed to be growing dangerously weaker. Giving him the necessary\\r\\nstimulant, she again stood by his bedside, watching and waiting.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Castaigne was no longer talking in his delirium. He had grown\\r\\nquieter and was staring, yet with an unseeing expression, at the\\r\\nceiling overhead. At this moment Eugenia discovered that the dawn had\\r\\ncome at last. A shaft of yellow light had entered the high window and\\r\\nshone across the wounded officer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face. It gave him such a curiously\\r\\ntransfigured look that for an instant Eugenia was frightened. But the\\r\\nnext, realizing what had occurred, she walked across to the window and\\r\\nstood looking out at the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning wind blew across her face. The dawn was a cold December one\\r\\nand yet the air was grateful. A little later Duke came and thrust his\\r\\ngreat head into Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand. Until this moment he had not left his\\r\\nplace by his master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bedside since twilight the day before. But now he\\r\\ntoo seemed to feel that there was nothing more love or vigilance could\\r\\ndo. One must simply wait.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe landscape was particularly lovely this morning, Eugenia thought. A\\r\\nwhite frost lay upon the meadows and trees like a veil, and one could\\r\\nnot see the devastation that the recent fighting must have brought\\r\\nupon the countryside. Eugenia had the right to feel rather like a\\r\\nprisoner, and yet she was not at this time conscious of herself. She\\r\\nwas wondering how the Countess Am\\xc3\\xa9lie could live when she learned that\\r\\nher only son had fallen a victim to the enemy who had despoiled her\\r\\nland and captured her home. She was an old woman and this would be too\\r\\nfull a measure of sorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long Eugenia stood at the window she did not know. It could\\r\\nscarcely have been more than a few moments, yet when she turned around\\r\\nshe was not aware of what had influenced her. Perhaps it was Duke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndesertion, for once more he had marched over to his master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side.\\r\\nHere, he stood sentinel with his eyes fixed on the young captain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nface. He no longer crouched upon the floor as he had been doing for the\\r\\npast twelve hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nStraightway Eugenia experienced a sudden rushing of warm blood to her\\r\\nown cheeks and a flooding sense of happiness and warmth.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Captain Castaigne was looking at her gravely, yet with entire\\r\\nrecognition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have come back to fight once more for France because of you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nwhispered. Then, in spite of his exhaustion, he tried gallantly to lift\\r\\nEugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fingers to his lips. But finding himself too weak, he simply\\r\\nlay still and smiled at her.\\r\\n\\r\\nUtterly ridiculous in a self-possessed person like Eugenia! But because\\r\\nshe felt a sudden overpowering inclination to burst into tears of\\r\\nrelief at her patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s safety, she frowned upon him sternly instead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are not to stir or speak until I return,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she announced severely,\\r\\nand then deliberately left the room. Of course, she intended to get\\r\\nsome simple nourishment for the young officer at once, but this was\\r\\nnot the important reason for her withdrawal. Certainly Eugenia did not\\r\\nso far intend to forget her dignity as a nurse as to show emotion!\\r\\n\\r\\nAt about noon on the same day Eugenia was cheerfully working downstairs\\r\\nin the little French kitchen, while Captain Castaigne was sleeping\\r\\nquietly upstairs with the door open so that she could hear his faintest\\r\\nmove.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the kitchen had to be seriously considered. The supply of food\\r\\nnecessary for an invalid was growing dangerously low in their larder,\\r\\nand for the next few weeks the wounded soldier must have proper\\r\\nnutriment. After an hour\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investigation Eugenia decided that she must\\r\\ngo to the village and see what could be done. It would be difficult to\\r\\nleave her patient alone, but his life was no longer in danger. Time\\r\\nwould bring healing, if nothing of an unexpected nature occurred.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Eugenia heard a gentle tapping at her kitchen door. It was much\\r\\nthe same noise that Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois had been accustomed to make on his daily\\r\\nvisits with supplies from the chateau. For a moment Eugenia hoped that\\r\\nFran\\xc3\\xa7ois might have come unexpectedly to their aid. But on opening the\\r\\ndoor, she found a wholly unexpected visitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nA young girl of about sixteen stood outside. At first Eugenia did not\\r\\nrecognize her. Then she saw that she wore a torn skirt and a little\\r\\nscarlet cap and that she was singularly pretty and graceful.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike a flash a picture came before her; it was the figure of a little\\r\\ngirl dancing before a group of French soldiers. What was the name\\r\\nBarbara had afterwards called her, the name of some character in an old\\r\\nFrench romance?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNicolete,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Eugenia said suddenly. And drawing the girl inside the\\r\\nlittle kitchen, she carefully closed the outside door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIX _Eugenia_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis year in the southern portion of France it was March, not May, that\\r\\ncame singing over the land. The days were soft and serene with the\\r\\nwarmth and sunshine of late spring.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn front of the Chateau d\\xe2\\x80\\x99Am\\xc3\\xa9lie a peacock walked slowly across the\\r\\nlawn, spreading his tail and then arching his neck in an effort to\\r\\nbehold his own grandeur. Near him two girls were walking up and down\\r\\nwith a young man dressed in the uniform of a British officer. Not far\\r\\naway in a somewhat neglected garden a French peasant woman was laying\\r\\na cloth on a wooden table and setting out cups and saucers of fine old\\r\\nchina. It was self-evident that an afternoon meal of some kind was in\\r\\npreparation and that the two girls and young man were waiting for it to\\r\\nbe made ready, and perhaps for other guests as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was all taking place in the very neighborhood which a few months\\r\\nbefore had been overrun by the German troops after the retreat of the\\r\\nFrench army. But the French had returned unto their own again, at least\\r\\nin this particular vicinity where the Chateau d\\xe2\\x80\\x99Am\\xc3\\xa9lie had stood for\\r\\nseveral centuries. Six weeks after their retreat before the superior\\r\\nforces of the German enemy, the French had retaken their deserted\\r\\ntrenches, after driving the enemy out of the neighborhood. More than\\r\\nthis, they had afterwards forced the Germans to retire a quarter of a\\r\\nmile further back beyond the borders of Alsace-Lorraine.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore happiness, or at least a degree of it, reigned once more in\\r\\nthis portion of France, and in no place perhaps was there a fuller\\r\\nshare than in the Chateau d\\xe2\\x80\\x99Am\\xc3\\xa9lie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you suppose has become of Captain Castaigne? He promised to\\r\\njoin us at four o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one of the girls inquired carelessly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore her question could be answered a wheeled chair appeared at one\\r\\nside of the garden with a young man seated in it. His face and figure\\r\\nsuggested a semi-invalid, but his costume revealed extreme care and\\r\\nelegance. Moreover, his expression was radiant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMes amis, you are more than welcome,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, speaking a rather\\r\\nabsurd mixture of French and English. Then turning to the little old\\r\\nman at the back of his chair he urged him to hurry, until the chair,\\r\\nits driver and rider, fairly rollicked over the uneven lawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere Captain Castaigne gravely shook hands with his guests, Nona\\r\\nDavis and Barbara Meade, who had just come to the chateau from the\\r\\nlittle \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFarmhouse with the Blue Front Door.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Afterwards he smiled at\\r\\nhis friend Lieutenant Robert Hume, who was at present a visitor in his\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMother will be here in a moment,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe has asked me to\\r\\nbeg her adored American girl friends to wait a few moments until she is\\r\\nable to be with them. The truth is, Madame la Comtesse is at present\\r\\nengaged in making _petit gateaux_--little cakes, I believe you say.\\r\\nShe would not trust the peasant Emma with so delicate a commission.\\r\\nBut where is Mademoiselle Paybod\\xc3\\xa9? Surely she has not forgotten her\\r\\npromise!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Castaigne\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face had suddenly changed; he seemed to be both\\r\\nannoyed and disappointed. So as usual Barbara spoke impulsively without\\r\\nthinking beforehand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, Eugenia is so tiresome!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she began with a little stamp of her\\r\\nfoot. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNona and I thought all along up until the very last minute that\\r\\nshe was coming with us this afternoon. Then she insisted that she had a\\r\\nslight headache and had best rest and read so it would not grow worse.\\r\\nThe truth is, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe she wanted to come. Besides, she had\\r\\nthe audacity to announce that she thought we would have a better time\\r\\nwithout her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Barbara ceased her confession, conscious that Nona was frowning\\r\\nupon her and that it was scarcely good manners to have spoken so\\r\\nfreely. When would she ever get over her dreadful western candor?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sure Barbara is mistaken in at least a portion of her tirade,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nNona interrupted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEugenia did have a headache or else she could not\\r\\nhave failed to wish to spend the afternoon with Madame Castaigne.\\r\\nReally, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think Eugenia is very well, although she will not admit\\r\\nit. But since we came back to the farmhouse she has never been just the\\r\\nsame. She does not do half such hard nursing as she once did and yet\\r\\nshe is often tired and unlike herself. I expect----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then Nona stopped\\r\\ntalking and laughed, for she had discovered Barbara smiling upon her\\r\\nwith wicked satisfaction. Having broken into the conversation to stem\\r\\nthe flood of Barbara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tactlessness, she had now plunged in even deeper\\r\\nthan her friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no one, however, to save her from the results of her\\r\\nstupidity, for Henri Castaigne had flushed and looked miserably\\r\\nuncomfortable as soon as she spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is small wonder that Miss Paybod\\xc3\\xa9 is not so strong as she once\\r\\nwas. When I think of all that she went through in those miserable weeks\\r\\nwith me, I cannot see how she endured it. It must have killed any one\\r\\nelse. Then there was the secrecy and the long concealment even when I\\r\\nhad sufficiently recovered to have been made a prisoner by the enemy.\\r\\nSuch strength, such courage! Mon Dieu, how shall I ever repay her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young French officer looked so unnecessarily tragic that to save\\r\\nthe situation his three friends laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, goodness, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to repay Eugenia! I am sure she really\\r\\nloved taking care of you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbara interposed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBesides, I expect she\\r\\nbullied you abominably. She adores bossing people. But there is my\\r\\nCountess, I know she wishes to speak to me first, since I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure she\\r\\nlikes me best. _Au revoir._\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And Barbara ran off in the direction of\\r\\nthe garden, where the figure of the Countess Am\\xc3\\xa9lie had just appeared,\\r\\nleaving her three companions to follow.\\r\\n\\r\\nNona then walked along by one side of Captain Castaigne\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chair, with\\r\\nLieutenant Hume on the other, while old Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois pushed nobly in the\\r\\nrear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French officer made no effort to hide his annoyance at Barbara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nfrankness. He was still weak and sometimes a little querulous after his\\r\\nlong illness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Meade does not understand, she does not appreciate Miss Paybod\\xc3\\xa9,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe began. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEven my mother, although she is on her knees to my friend\\r\\nbecause of her great kindness to me, even she cannot see all that\\r\\nEugeni\\xc3\\xa9 has been, all that she is----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis appeared to be a conversation of unfinished sentences, of things\\r\\nbetter left unsaid, for Captain Castaigne now looked as if he would\\r\\ngive a great deal to have kept his last remark to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Nona Davis had the exquisite tact of many southern girls and\\r\\napparently had heard only the first part of her host\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, you must not misunderstand Barbara and Eugenia,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she explained.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMost of the time they disagree on every subject. But the truth is\\r\\nthey are really tremendously fond of each other. Why, now that Mildred\\r\\nThornton is in Paris with her brother Dick, I feel quite left out.\\r\\nBarbara used to weep for Eugenia every night after we made our escape\\r\\nwith your mother and Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois through the passage under the chateau.\\r\\nYou see when we learned that she was not with Mildred, but had been\\r\\nleft behind, naturally we supposed that something dreadful had happened\\r\\nto her. And of course Barbara understood how self-sacrificing Eugenia\\r\\nalways is and feared she had given her life for some one else. If you\\r\\nonly knew how happy we all were when we finally learned that you were\\r\\nboth alive and that Eugenia was caring for you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut how did you hear?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lieutenant Hume demanded. The little party had\\r\\nnow almost reached the garden where the table was spread for their\\r\\nentertainment, so there was but little time for Nona\\xe2\\x80\\x99s story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, we heard through a little French girl, Nicolete. You see, she came\\r\\nto the farmhouse one day to see Eugenia, and after they had talked a\\r\\nwhile Eugenia discovered that she was a friend of Captain Castaigne\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\nThen she told her that he was in hiding. After that Nicolete used to\\r\\ncome every day and bring supplies and seemed devoted to Eugenia. Well,\\r\\nyou remember Madame told you how Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois finally made his way back\\r\\nto this neighborhood to try and find out what had become of Captain\\r\\nCastaigne. You see the Countess was in despair, as naturally we all\\r\\nbelieved that Captain Castaigne had been killed or taken prisoner, but\\r\\nFran\\xc3\\xa7ois would not give up. He was unkindly treated by the Germans when\\r\\nhe first came home, but afterwards they allowed him to work for them.\\r\\nThen of course he saw Nicolete and she told him what had happened. So\\r\\nwe actually knew where Eugenia and Captain Castaigne were before we\\r\\nwere able to get back here. But you can imagine how anxious we used to\\r\\nfeel for fear they would be discovered and something dreadful done to\\r\\nboth of them!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a perfectly ripping story,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lieutenant Hume answered\\r\\nconvincingly. But he added nothing more, as Madame Castaigne at this\\r\\nmoment came forward to greet Nona. Actually the old French lady put\\r\\nboth her hands on Nona\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cheeks and kissed her daintily on the lips.\\r\\nFor the two young American girls had become her devoted friends and\\r\\nadmirers during the weeks they spent together after their escape from\\r\\nthe chateau.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn hour later they were still sitting talking cheerfully together\\r\\nin the old French garden. Only their host had disappeared. Captain\\r\\nCastaigne had asked to be excused, and as he was still an invalid no\\r\\none thought seriously of his departure. Presumably he had retired\\r\\nto his own apartments to rest. But the young French officer had not\\r\\nfelt like going indoors, although he was not in the mood for further\\r\\nconversation. As it was still early in the afternoon he had asked\\r\\nFran\\xc3\\xa7ois to wheel his chair down into the woods which lay between the\\r\\nchateau and the little \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFarmhouse with the Blue Front Door.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XX _The Pool of Truth_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere by the pool on a log with a book in her lap sat Eugenia. She\\r\\nwas not reading, however, although her book lay open. At the sound of\\r\\nCaptain Castaigne\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chair approaching she looked toward him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expression was severe on this occasion, not Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sorry to intrude upon you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he began stiffly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour friends told\\r\\nme that you were suffering from a headache; naturally I did not expect\\r\\nto find you here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response Eugenia smiled good-naturedly, just as one might to a\\r\\nfretful child. She had gotten up at once and now came forward and took\\r\\nthe young man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI did have a headache, Captain Castaigne. I am too good a Puritan to\\r\\nhave told a complete story. But while I did not feel well enough to\\r\\nsee and talk to a number of persons, I did not desire to go to bed,\\r\\nwhere Barbara was pleased to send me by way of punishment. Besides,\\r\\nI knew your mother would prefer to have the two girls to herself. I\\r\\nreally think she misses them now that they can see so little of each\\r\\nother. But why talk about me? You are stronger every day, aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you?\\r\\nCan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you walk with your crutches if Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois is near? Come, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you\\r\\ntry now? I am sure I can catch you if you are too much for Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo spots of angry color appeared in Captain Castaigne\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am through with your support, Miss Paybod\\xc3\\xa9,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he returned curtly.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I choose to walk I prefer not to be held up by a woman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Eugenia answered, and stared at her former patient helplessly.\\r\\nWhat had she said or done to make him so angry?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the next instant the young officer had taken her hand and in French\\r\\nfashion touched it with his lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cForgive me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am impossible. This, after I depended on you\\r\\nso long for every care. If you will be so good, I think I should like\\r\\nto sit there on the log where you were sitting.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring his illness Eugenia had grown so accustomed to these swift\\r\\nchanges of mood in her patient that she paid no especial attention to\\r\\nthis one. Instead she helped him out of his chair and kept at his side\\r\\nwhile he hobbled over to the log she had just deserted.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when she stood above him looking down upon him with pride and\\r\\nsatisfaction over his achievement he grew angry again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you cannot sit beside me I have no idea of taking your place,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nprotested.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next instant Eugenia sank meekly down. It rather amused her to have\\r\\nCaptain Castaigne treat her in this fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust before them was the small lake which Nona and Barbara had\\r\\ndiscovered the first morning after their arrival at the farmhouse. It\\r\\nwas shadowy now with the coming of evening, but still the water was\\r\\ncoolly clear. Its beauty soothed one to silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Eugenia who spoke first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am glad to have this moment here with you, Captain Castaigne,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nbegan, with a return to her former manner. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause I wish to tell you\\r\\nand have you explain to your mother that Nona and Barbara and I may be\\r\\nleaving this part of the country in a little while. The truth is, our\\r\\nservices as nurses are not needed here as they were some months ago.\\r\\nThere is little fighting going on and several new French nurses came\\r\\ndown from Paris the other day. Besides this, Mrs. Thornton and Judge\\r\\nThornton have grown very nervous and unhappy over Mildred, as well as\\r\\nthe rest of us, in the last few weeks. They have both written to urge\\r\\nme to persuade the other girls to join me and go into Belgium to help\\r\\nwith the relief work there. You are almost well now, so I shall be able\\r\\nto say good-by with much greater satisfaction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis last speech Eugenia made in a gracious tone and yet her companion\\r\\nreceived it ungraciously. And this in spite of the fact that his manner\\r\\nwas usually charming.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is no time when you would not say good-by to me with\\r\\nsatisfaction, Miss Paybod\\xc3\\xa9,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he returned. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHowever, if I am spared\\r\\nperhaps I may some day show my appreciation of your great kindness.\\r\\nI have written my colonel to say that I shall be able to rejoin my\\r\\ncommand in another week or ten days. I have wasted much valuable\\r\\ntime with two illnesses. Perhaps the third may be my lucky one!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nfinished, casting his dark eyes upward with dramatic intensity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn reply Eugenia actually patted his knee in a comforting, motherly\\r\\nfashion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be absurd. You cannot return to your command for two or three\\r\\nmonths at least,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she admonished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwo or three weeks shall be the limit to my patience,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d her companion\\r\\nrepeated, still talking like a sulky boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia frowned. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall speak to your mother. She will never allow\\r\\nit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Again her manner was that of a New England school teacher.\\r\\nNevertheless Captain Castaigne did not smile. Yet he seemed to have\\r\\nforgotten his age and dignity as well as rank in the army, for you see\\r\\nhe had been a good many weeks under Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s discipline.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe day you go to Belgium I shall return to my post,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he muttered.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia would like to have shaken him. Had he been in the little\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFarmhouse with the Blue Front Door,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she would simply have gotten up\\r\\nat this instant and left her patient until he had learned to behave\\r\\nhimself. But at present the circumstances were different, and besides\\r\\nshe might not have a chance to talk to him again. So somehow he must be\\r\\nmade to behave sensibly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou will do no such thing. You owe more than that to me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Eugenia\\r\\nprotested unexpectedly. A few moments before she would not have\\r\\nbelieved that any earthly thing could have forced her to mention,\\r\\neither to Captain Castaigne or to any one else, the sacrifices which\\r\\nshe had made for him. But now she had spoken deliberately and meaning\\r\\nexactly what she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless the young French officer did not answer immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEugeni\\xc3\\xa9,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said finally, and the querulous, boyish note in his voice\\r\\nhad quite gone, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou must listen to me. I have been talking like a\\r\\nchild, but I am scarcely surprised at myself, since you have always\\r\\ninsisted upon treating me as scarcely more than a child. I have borne\\r\\nwith it because I have been ill and you have known me only in that\\r\\ncondition. But, Eugeni\\xc3\\xa9, I will endure it no longer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice held a quietly determined quality. He was\\r\\nperfectly courteous and yet his listener understood at this instant why\\r\\nhe was considered one of the most forceful as well as one of the most\\r\\npopular of the younger officers in the French service.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless Eugenia scarcely knew how or what to reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am so sorry, Captain Castaigne,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have not intended\\r\\nto fail in respect to you. But perhaps I have unintentionally presumed\\r\\non your long weakness and dependence upon me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this from Eugenia! Moreover, her face had flushed and she could not\\r\\nlift her lids because of the tears in her eyes. Yet she was not really\\r\\nangry with Captain Castaigne.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next time he spoke his voice was once more gentle and he even\\r\\nmanaged to smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know that is not what I mean in the least. It is absurd of you\\r\\nto talk of showing proper respect to me, Eugeni\\xc3\\xa9, as if I were your\\r\\ncommanding officer. Surely you understand that when a man cares for a\\r\\nwoman as I do for you, there is but one thing possible between them.\\r\\nThey must love each other fully and equally. I know you have nothing\\r\\nbut a kindly feeling for me, but you shall not go away, when I may\\r\\nnever see you again, without hearing the truth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nStill Eugenia did not understand! Nevertheless her face grew pale\\r\\ninstead of flushed and her dark eyes gazed into her companion\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost\\r\\ncuriously.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet the next moment, when Captain Castaigne touched her hand with\\r\\ninfinite gentleness and respect, she drew it coldly away from him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI quite understand your gratitude, Captain Castaigne. But please\\r\\nappreciate the fact that it is unnecessary for you to go this far to\\r\\nexpress your obligation. I have only done for you what I would have\\r\\ndone for any one in the world under the same circumstances.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am entirely aware of that fact,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the young officer answered curtly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he and Eugenia both maintained a dignified silence for the space\\r\\nof sixty seconds.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time the girl rose up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is our good-by, perhaps. We may not see each other alone again.\\r\\nYou must forgive me if I seem to be cold and unfeeling. Of course, I\\r\\nshould have cared for any one just as I cared for you. But I should not\\r\\nhave been so glad to have been given the opportunity had my patient\\r\\nbeen any other person.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Eugenia was trying her best to cast aside the\\r\\ncold and formal manner which had made her misunderstood all the days\\r\\nof her life. In her earnestness somehow she looked younger and humbler\\r\\nthan usual. Indeed, she was a very fair and lovely woman standing\\r\\nthere with her hands clasped before her. Her eyes were shining with\\r\\nthe sincerity of her emotion, while her attitude expressed a strange\\r\\nmixture of dignity and appeal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen we first met each other, Captain Castaigne, I confess I had a\\r\\nwrong idea of you. Now I feel that I could have rendered France no\\r\\ngreater service than to have saved your life. Since I came abroad to\\r\\nnurse in order to help the little I am able, perhaps my coming has not\\r\\nbeen in vain. Good-by.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was moving away, when the young officer reached out and took hold\\r\\nof her skirt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlease don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go for another moment,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he pleaded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course I\\r\\nunderstand that so noble a woman cannot love a man who has so little to\\r\\noffer as I have. Why, in spite of all our lands, my mother and I are\\r\\nlittle more than paupers! And if I am spared when this war is over,\\r\\nperhaps I shall always be lame.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl was standing looking down at the young fellow whose head was\\r\\nslightly bowed, when instinctively she laid her firm, beautiful hand\\r\\non his head with unconscious sympathy and tenderness. She had done the\\r\\nsame thing so many times before during his illness. But Eugenia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand\\r\\nnow trembled a little, for she was slowly beginning to appreciate what\\r\\nCaptain Castaigne had been trying to say to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurious, for Eugenia to think first that she had never received a\\r\\nproposal before in her life, or she might have known better how to\\r\\nreceive it. Then her next sensation was an odd combination of gratitude\\r\\nand protest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have been very stupid, Captain Castaigne, and you have been very\\r\\ngood,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut even if you believe what you have just said\\r\\nto me, and of course I know that you would not deceive me, you yourself\\r\\nmust realize that nothing but friendship can ever exist between us.\\r\\nI am several years older than you, and I have no delusions about my\\r\\nown attractions. You are young and brilliant, but then I need not\\r\\nenumerate your gifts,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the girl added, smiling with a kind of gentle\\r\\nhumorousness she had never possessed before. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll this is merely\\r\\ngratitude you feel toward me, and a little affection because of my care\\r\\nof you. Six months from now I shall be only a memory.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen you _do not_ love me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Captain Castaigne inquired bluntly. He it\\r\\nwas who had now cast aside all his soft graciousness of manner, the\\r\\ndelicate evasions of the direct truth, that sometimes constitute what\\r\\nis known as a charming manner. It was Eugenia who, in spite of her\\r\\nPuritan faith and training, was refusing to meet the issue fairly.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated because the truth overwhelmed her. The idea of caring for\\r\\nCaptain Castaigne except as a friend had never for a single instant\\r\\nbefore occurred to her. Of course, he had filled her life and thoughts\\r\\nfor many weeks, but that was because of the peculiar situation into\\r\\nwhich they had been forced by circumstances. Moreover, the thought of\\r\\ntheir never meeting again had given her a sense of loss and emptiness.\\r\\nYet Eugenia stuck by her colors gallantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is not the important question, Captain Castaigne, and I cannot\\r\\nanswer you. For always there would remain an impossible gulf between\\r\\nus. There is your position, your mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disappointment, our different\\r\\nways of looking at life. Why, you would soon become dreadfully ashamed\\r\\nof a New England old maid endeavoring to turn herself into a charming\\r\\nyoung wife.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEugenia glanced into the little pool of water near by, shadowed by the\\r\\ntrees. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNona has been calling this tiny lake \\xe2\\x80\\x98The Pool of Melisande,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nCaptain Castaigne, but to me it is a mirror of truth, in which I can\\r\\nsee myself only too plainly. It is growing late and you must not be\\r\\nout in the cold air. Please let me call Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois and have him take you\\r\\nhome.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nReceiving no reply but a quiet look of determination, Eugenia summoned\\r\\nthe old man. Then she assisted Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois to get the young officer back\\r\\ninto his wheeled chair and afterwards stood watching them until they\\r\\nhad both disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, as it was almost twilight, Eugenia turned and began to walk\\r\\nslowly toward the little French farmhouse. She realized that she had\\r\\njust deliberately turned her back upon the fairest opportunity life\\r\\nmight ever offer her. Nevertheless, both her conscience and her brain\\r\\napproved her action.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is only one thing which I might have confided and did not,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nEugenia murmured reflectively. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps I should have explained that it\\r\\nwould not matter in the least that Henri and his mother have no money.\\r\\nI have more than enough for us all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then as she drew nearer home:\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever mind, Captain Castaigne will soon have forgotten what he has\\r\\njust said to me. But perhaps it is just as well that we are soon to go\\r\\ninto Belgium to help with the Red Cross work there, for I may not find\\r\\nit quite so easy to forget.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she reached home it was dark. But as the other girls had not\\r\\nyet returned from the chateau, Eugenia went upstairs to her own room\\r\\nwithout making a light.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\r\\nwww.gutenberg.org \\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary \\r\\nArchive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\\r\\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\\r\\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\\r\\nlocations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\\r\\nLake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to\\r\\ndate contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and\\r\\nofficial page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nFor additional contact information:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\r\\n    Chief Executive and Director\\r\\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n'"
